Discontinue if: ulcer healed, ulcer not improving and surface not helping, patient discharged to facility with surfaces. NOT covered: Stage 1 ulcers (controversial - some MACs cover prevention for high risk), comfort without medical necessity. **NY MEDICAID:** Group 1 surfaces: May approve with documentation. Group 2-3: Requires prior approval. Submit: Braden Scale score, ulcer assessment (Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing), risk factors documentation, photos, treatment plan. Usually approved for hospital discharge with existing ulcers. Prevention approval harder - need strong risk documentation. **DENIAL PREVENTION:** Document risk factors using Braden Scale (score ≤18 = at risk). For treatment: complete wound assessment (PUSH tool), staging, measurements, photos. For Group 2-3: document failed trial of Group 1 surface (duration, why inadequate). Common denial: "not medically necessary" - strengthen by including wound care nurse evaluation, plastic surgery/dermatology consult, comprehensive treatment plan. For prevention (no existing ulcer): document immobility, Braden score, skin breakdown risk, why surface will prevent ulcer (usually needs strong justification). --- ## DM21: TRACTION EQUIPMENT (20 codes) **INDICATIONS:** Cervical spine injuries, fractures, post-surgical immobilization.
