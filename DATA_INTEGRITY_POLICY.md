# Data Integrity Policy for Clinical Coverage Reference

**Version:** 1.1
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-29
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29 (simplified tagging system)
**Purpose:** Ensure accuracy and reliability of clinical coverage documentation for medical prescribers

---

## üéØ Core Principle

**Accuracy over completeness.** This documentation will be used by physicians and prescribing facilities to make clinical and billing decisions. Incorrect information is worse than missing information.

---

## üìä Four-Tier Confidence System

All data entered into reference files must be classified by confidence level and tagged accordingly.

### Tier 1: Direct from Source (100% Confidence)

**Definition:** Information explicitly stated in source documents (research docs, CSV, official policies).

**Action:** Include as-is, no tags needed.

**Examples:**
```yaml
medicare:
  covered: true  # Source doc states "Medicare - Clinical Usage: ..."
  prior_auth: false  # Source doc states "NO PA"
  documentation_type: "DWO"  # Source explicitly says "Detailed Written Order (DWO)"
```

```markdown
**Medicare - Clinical Usage:** Perineal injury or infection as part of prescribed treatment regimen for home use.
```

**Quality Check:** Can you point to the exact line in source document?
- ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Tier 1
- ‚ùå No ‚Üí Lower tier

---

### Tier 2: High Confidence Inference (90%+ Confidence)

**Definition:** Logical extension or synthesis of explicit source data. The inference is almost certain based on clear patterns or medical/policy logic.

**Action:** Include with `(Under Review - High Confidence)` tag in YAML or markdown. Add detailed reasoning to `data_quality.field_notes` section.

**When to use:**
- Combining related statements from source into single field
- Standard Medicare/Medicaid patterns consistently applied
- Medical logic clearly supporting the inference

**Examples:**
```yaml
frequency_limit: "Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)
special_notes: "Patient must be confined"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)

icd10_primary:
  - "Z99.3 - Dependence on wheelchair"  # Explicitly in source
  - "R26.2 - Difficulty in walking"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)

# Detailed explanations go in data_quality section
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    frequency_limit: "Source says '5-year reasonable useful lifetime' - inferred standard frequency wording"
    icd10_r26_2: "Logically related to mobility issues mentioned in source; standard code for difficulty walking"
```

```markdown
**Important Notes:**
- Must meet E0163 criteria first (Under Review - High Confidence)
```

**Quality Check:** Would a medical professional reading the source reach the same conclusion?
- ‚úÖ Almost certainly ‚Üí Tier 2 with (Under Review - High Confidence) tag
- ‚ùå Maybe, maybe not ‚Üí Tier 3

---

### Tier 3: Educated Guess (50-90% Confidence)

**Definition:** Reasonable assumption based on partial information, industry standards, or comparison to similar codes, but not directly verifiable from source.

**Action:** Include with `(Under Review)` tag. Add detailed reasoning to `data_quality.field_notes` section.

**When to use:**
- Field likely true but not explicitly stated
- Assumption based on similar codes
- Standard practice but not confirmed in this specific case

**Examples:**
```yaml
requires_specialty_eval: false  # (Under Review)
quantity_limit: "1 per patient"  # (Under Review)
face_to_face: false  # (Under Review)

# Detailed explanations go in data_quality section
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    requires_specialty_eval: "Not mentioned in source document; typical for standard DME items"
    quantity_limit: "Not explicitly stated in source; typical pattern for this type of equipment"
    face_to_face: "Not specified in source; typical for accessories but requires verification"
```

```markdown
**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard written order required (Under Review)
```

**Quality Check:** Is this a guess or semi-certain?
- ‚úÖ Reasonably certain but can't prove ‚Üí Tier 3 with (Under Review) tag
- ‚ùå Just guessing ‚Üí Tier 4

---

### Tier 4: Unknown (<50% Confidence)

**Definition:** No reliable basis for filling in this field from available sources.

**Action:** Leave blank or use explicit "Unknown" placeholder.

**When to use:**
- Source document doesn't mention this aspect
- No similar codes to reference
- Conflicting or unclear information

**Examples:**
```yaml
frequency_limit: ""  # Unknown - verify with payer
quantity_limit: ""  # Not specified in source documentation
special_notes: "Coverage details require verification with payer"
```

```markdown
**NY Medicaid Requirements:**
*Coverage criteria not found in source documentation. Verify with NYRx (518) 486-3209 before prescribing.*
```

**Quality Check:** Do I have any reliable basis for this?
- ‚úÖ No ‚Üí Leave blank or mark Unknown
- ‚ùå I could guess ‚Üí Still Tier 4, don't guess

---

## üö´ Never Acceptable

The following practices are **strictly prohibited**:

1. **Making up data** - Never fabricate coverage criteria, diagnosis codes, or requirements
2. **Guessing at critical fields** without tagging:
   - Coverage (covered: true/false)
   - Prior authorization requirements
   - Billing modifiers
   - Frequency/quantity limits
3. **Copying from different codes** without verification (codes may differ)
4. **Removing uncertainty** - If unsure, mark it; don't hide uncertainty
5. **Mixing jurisdictions** - Don't assume Nassau = Brooklyn or Medicare = Medicaid

---

## üîç When to Search External Sources

**Use WebSearch/WebFetch selectively for:**

### ‚úÖ Appropriate Searches:
- **Verify discontinued codes**: "Is HCPCS code K0553 still active 2025?"
- **Confirm replacements**: "What replaced K0553 effective 2023?"
- **Check ICD-10 validity**: "Is R26.2 a valid ICD-10 code?"
- **Verify policy numbers**: "Medicare LCD L33736"
- **Confirm specific dates**: "When did NY Medicaid CGM policy change?"

### ‚ùå Avoid Searching For:
- Coverage criteria (too jurisdiction-specific, use source docs)
- Frequency limits (payer-specific, use source docs)
- Clinical indications (should be in research docs)
- Documentation requirements (complex, use source docs)
- "Filling gaps" in missing data (leads to mixed-source confusion)

### üéØ Search Protocol:
1. Search only for specific factual questions
2. Limit to 1-2 searches per code to avoid overload
3. Document search results in `source_documents` if used
4. Still apply 4-tier confidence system to searched data

---

## üìã Required Quality Metadata

Each file must include a `data_quality` section in YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
# Data Quality Tracking
data_quality:
  primary_source: "DM02, DM05, DM06.md (lines 47-56)"
  source_verified_fields: ["clinical_indications", "medicare.covered", "medicaid_nassau.covered", "prior_auth", "dvs_authorization"]
  high_confidence_fields: ["some_icd10_codes", "frequency_limit_wording"]
  needs_verification: ["quantity_limit", "requires_specialty_eval", "face_to_face"]
  external_searches: []  # List any web searches performed
  field_notes:
    icd10_r26_2: "Logically related to mobility issues mentioned in source; standard code for difficulty walking"
    frequency_limit: "Source says '5-year reasonable useful lifetime' - inferred standard frequency wording"
    quantity_limit: "Not explicitly stated in source; typical pattern for this type of equipment"
    face_to_face: "Not specified in source document; requires payer verification"
  last_verified: "2025-10-29"
  verified_by: "Claude Code"
```

**Field Definitions:**

- `primary_source`: Main research document(s) used, with specific line numbers
- `source_verified_fields`: Fields directly from source (Tier 1 - no tags)
- `high_confidence_fields`: Fields using (Under Review - High Confidence) tag (Tier 2)
- `needs_verification`: Fields using (Under Review) tag (Tier 3) or blank (Tier 4)
- `external_searches`: Any web searches conducted, with URLs
- `field_notes`: Detailed explanations for tagged fields - why inferred, what's uncertain, etc.
- `last_verified`: Date of last review
- `verified_by`: Who verified (human name or "Claude Code")

---

## üîÑ Review Process

### Initial Creation:
1. Read source document(s) thoroughly
2. Extract Tier 1 data (direct statements)
3. Identify Tier 2 data (clear inferences) and tag
4. Mark Tier 3 data (guesses) with (Under Review)
5. Leave Tier 4 data (unknown) blank
6. Complete `data_quality` section

### Before Committing:
- [ ] All critical fields (covered, prior_auth) are Tier 1 or 2
- [ ] All high confidence inferences tagged with (Under Review - High Confidence)
- [ ] All educated guesses tagged with (Under Review) or left blank
- [ ] `data_quality` section completed with field_notes for tagged fields
- [ ] Source document referenced with line numbers

### Periodic Review (Human):
- Review all (Under Review) fields
- Verify all (Under Review - High Confidence) fields
- Fill blanks with additional research
- Update `last_verified` and `verified_by`

---

## üìù Tagging Examples

### In YAML Frontmatter:
```yaml
medicare:
  covered: true  # Tier 1: No tag (explicit in source)
  prior_auth: false  # (Under Review - High Confidence)
  frequency_limit: "Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)
  quantity_limit: "1 per patient"  # (Under Review)
  special_notes: "KX modifier required when criteria met"  # Tier 1: No tag

icd10_primary:
  - "Z99.3 - Dependence on wheelchair"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)
  - "R26.2 - Difficulty in walking"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)

# Explanations go in field_notes
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    prior_auth: "Not mentioned in source document; inferred from absence which is typical for standard DME"
    frequency_limit: "Source says '5-year reasonable useful lifetime' - inferred standard frequency wording"
    quantity_limit: "Not explicitly stated in source; typical pattern for this type of equipment"
    icd10_codes: "Logically related to mobility issues mentioned in source; standard codes for conditions"
```

### In Markdown Narrative:
```markdown
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient confined to single room
- Physically incapable of using regular toilet

**Important Notes:**
- Typically limited to 1 per 12 months (Under Review)
```

---

## üéØ Critical vs. Non-Critical Fields

### Critical Fields (Must be Tier 1 or 2 only):
- `covered` (true/false)
- `prior_auth` (true/false)
- `dvs_authorization` (true/false)
- `modifiers` (billing codes)
- Clinical indications (primary list)
- Coverage requirements (basic criteria)

**Rationale:** These directly affect billing and prescribing decisions. Errors here cause claim denials or compliance issues.

### Non-Critical Fields (Can be Tier 3-4):
- `requires_specialty_eval` (nice to know, not billing-critical)
- `requires_resna_atp` (informational)
- Extended ICD-10 lists beyond primary codes
- Related codes (helpful but not essential)
- Some special notes (context, not requirements)

**Rationale:** These provide helpful context but won't cause billing errors if missing or approximate.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Cases

### "Verify Code Availability" Pattern:
When source says "Verify code availability with NY Medicaid":
```yaml
medicaid_nassau:
  covered: true  # (Under Review)
  special_notes: "VERIFY code availability with NYRx (518) 486-3209 before prescribing"

data_quality:
  field_notes:
    medicaid_covered: "Source says verify availability - uncertain if code is in active fee schedule"
```

### Discontinued Codes:
```yaml
discontinued: true
special_notes: "CODE DISCONTINUED 1/1/2023 - Replaced by A4239"
medicare:
  covered: false
  special_notes: "Claims submitted after 1/1/2023 denied. Use A4239 instead."
```

### "Same as [CODE]" Pattern:
When source says "Same as E0163":
```yaml
# Reference the other code
clinical_indications:
  - "Same as E0163"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)
special_notes: "See E0163 for base coverage criteria"  # (Under Review - High Confidence)

data_quality:
  field_notes:
    clinical_indications: "Source states 'same as E0163' - inferred complete criteria from E0163 documentation"
```

But still complete the full details by referencing E0163's data.

---

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Source Citations:
Always include specific references in files:
```markdown
## References

- Medicare LCD L33736 (DME & Surgical Dressings)
- NY Medicaid DME Manual (effective 10/1/2025)
- Source document: DM02, DM05, DM06.md (lines 45-56)
```

### Uncertainty Language:
Be explicit about uncertainty in narrative sections:
- "Typically limited to..." (indicates pattern, not certainty)
- "Generally requires..." (common but not universal)
- "May require..." (possible, not definite)
- "Verify with payer..." (definitely check before assuming)

## üîÑ Version Control

This policy may evolve. When updating:

1. Update version number
2. Document changes in git commit
3. Review existing files for compliance with new standards
4. Update `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` with policy changes

**Current Version:** 1.0 (Initial policy - 2025-10-29)

---
