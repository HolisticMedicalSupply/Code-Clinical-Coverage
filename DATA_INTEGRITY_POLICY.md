# Data Integrity Policy for Clinical Coverage Reference

**Version:** 1.4
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-30
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30 (Added E0784 Comprehensive Standard as Gold Standard benchmark)
**Purpose:** Ensure accuracy and reliability of clinical coverage documentation for medical prescribers

**üö® CRITICAL CHANGE IN v1.3:**
- Tags must be **part of the string value**, NOT in YAML comments (#)
- Comments are not parsed and won't display in HTML
- For boolean fields needing tags, convert to string: `"false (Under Review)"`
- For string fields, append tag: `"Once every 5 years (Under Review - High Confidence)"`

---

## üéØ Core Principle

**Accuracy over completeness.** This documentation will be used by physicians and prescribing facilities to make clinical and billing decisions. Incorrect information is worse than missing information.

---

## üìä Four-Tier Confidence System

All data entered into reference files must be classified by confidence level and tagged accordingly.

### Tier 1: Direct from Source (100% Confidence)

**Definition:** Information explicitly stated in source documents (research docs, CSV, official policies).

**Action:** Include as-is, no tags needed.

**Examples:**
```yaml
medicare:
  covered: true  # Source doc states "Medicare - Clinical Usage: ..."
  prior_auth: false  # Source doc states "NO PA"
  documentation_type: "DWO"  # Source explicitly says "Detailed Written Order (DWO)"
```

```markdown
**Medicare - Clinical Usage:** Perineal injury or infection as part of prescribed treatment regimen for home use.
```

**Quality Check:** Can you point to the exact line in source document?
- ‚úÖ Yes ‚Üí Tier 1
- ‚ùå No ‚Üí Lower tier

---

### Tier 2: High Confidence Inference (90%+ Confidence)

**Definition:** Logical extension or synthesis of explicit source data. The inference is almost certain based on clear patterns or medical/policy logic.

**Action:** Include `(Under Review - High Confidence)` tag **as part of the string value** in YAML, or inline in markdown. Add detailed reasoning to `data_quality.field_notes` section.

**CRITICAL:** Tags must be part of the value, NOT in YAML comments. Comments are not parsed and won't display in HTML.

**When to use:**
- Combining related statements from source into single field
- Standard Medicare/Medicaid patterns consistently applied
- Medical logic clearly supporting the inference

**Examples:**
```yaml
# For string fields, append tag to the string value:
frequency_limit: "Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime) (Under Review - High Confidence)"
special_notes: "Patient must be confined (Under Review - High Confidence)"

# For boolean fields needing tags, convert to string with tag:
prior_auth: "false (Under Review - High Confidence)"
face_to_face: "false (Under Review)"

# For lists, append tag to each inferred item:
icd10_primary:
  - "Z99.3 - Dependence on wheelchair"  # Explicitly in source - no tag
  - "R26.2 - Difficulty in walking (Under Review - High Confidence)"
  - "M62.81 - Muscle weakness (Under Review - High Confidence)"

# Verified fields stay as native types (boolean, etc.):
covered: true  # Direct from source
dvs_authorization: true  # Direct from source

# Detailed explanations go in data_quality section
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    frequency_limit: "Source says '5-year reasonable useful lifetime' - inferred standard frequency wording"
    prior_auth: "Not mentioned in source; inferred from absence (typical for standard DME)"
    icd10_r26_2: "Logically related to mobility issues mentioned in source; standard code for difficulty walking"
```

```markdown
**Important Notes:**
- Must meet E0163 criteria first (Under Review - High Confidence)
```

**Quality Check:** Would a medical professional reading the source reach the same conclusion?
- ‚úÖ Almost certainly ‚Üí Tier 2 with (Under Review - High Confidence) tag
- ‚ùå Maybe, maybe not ‚Üí Tier 3

---

### Tier 3: Educated Guess (50-90% Confidence)

**Definition:** Reasonable assumption based on partial information, industry standards, or comparison to similar codes, but not directly verifiable from source.

**Action:** Include `(Under Review)` tag **as part of the string value**. Add detailed reasoning to `data_quality.field_notes` section.

**When to use:**
- Field likely true but not explicitly stated
- Assumption based on similar codes
- Standard practice but not confirmed in this specific case

**Examples:**
```yaml
# For boolean fields needing tags, convert to string:
requires_specialty_eval: "false (Under Review)"
face_to_face: "false (Under Review)"

# For string fields, append tag:
quantity_limit: "1 per patient (Under Review)"

# Detailed explanations go in data_quality section
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    requires_specialty_eval: "Not mentioned in source document; typical for standard DME items"
    quantity_limit: "Not explicitly stated in source; typical pattern for this type of equipment"
    face_to_face: "Not specified in source; typical for accessories but requires verification"
```

```markdown
**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard written order required (Under Review)
```

**Quality Check:** Is this a guess or semi-certain?
- ‚úÖ Reasonably certain but can't prove ‚Üí Tier 3 with (Under Review) tag
- ‚ùå Just guessing ‚Üí Tier 4

---

### Tier 4: Unknown (<50% Confidence)

**Definition:** No reliable basis for filling in this field from available sources.

**Action:** Leave blank or use explicit "Unknown" placeholder.

**When to use:**
- Source document doesn't mention this aspect
- No similar codes to reference
- Conflicting or unclear information

**Examples:**
```yaml
frequency_limit: ""  # Unknown - verify with payer
quantity_limit: ""  # Not specified in source documentation
special_notes: "Coverage details require verification with payer"
```

```markdown
**NY Medicaid Requirements:**
*Coverage criteria not found in source documentation. Verify with NYRx (518) 486-3209 before prescribing.*
```

**Quality Check:** Do I have any reliable basis for this?
- ‚úÖ No ‚Üí Leave blank or mark Unknown
- ‚ùå I could guess ‚Üí Still Tier 4, don't guess

---

## üìù Tagging Narrative Markdown Content

**IMPORTANT:** Data integrity tags apply to **both YAML frontmatter AND narrative Markdown sections**. All information in the file will be displayed to physicians in the HTML catalog and must be tagged for legal protection and accuracy.

### Where to Apply Tags in Narrative

Tags should be applied to **specific claims, requirements, or statements** in these sections:

1. **Clinical Overview** - Coverage criteria, typical use cases
2. **Coverage Details** (Medicare/Medicaid sections) - Requirements, documentation needs, frequency
3. **Documentation Requirements** - Specific prescription elements
4. **Common Denial Reasons** - Specific reasons and fixes
5. **Tips for Approval** - Suggested strategies or requirements
6. **Important Notes** - Any coverage claims or requirements

### What to Tag

**Tag these types of statements:**
- Specific requirements not explicit in source ("Typically requires..." "Generally limited to...")
- Documentation needs inferred from patterns ("Standard written order required")
- Frequency/quantity claims ("Typically limited to 1 per 12 months")
- Coverage criteria synthesis ("Patient must meet E0163 criteria first")
- Approval tips based on inference ("Best practice is...")
- Common denial reasons if inferred ("May be denied if...")

**Don't tag these:**
- Direct quotes from source documents
- Factual descriptions ("This is a bedpan made of plastic")
- Item names and basic definitions
- Structural headings
- References to other sections ("See E0163 for details")

### How to Apply Tags

**Use inline parenthetical tags immediately after the statement:**

```markdown
**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician prescription required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document bed-confined status in medical record
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Proof of delivery required
- Typically limited to 1 per 12 months *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
```

**Or after full sentences:**

```markdown
Medicare considers footrests as not primarily medical in nature. *(Under Review - High Confidence)* Considered convenience/comfort item. *(Under Review - High Confidence)* No reimbursement available under Medicare.
```

**Or inline within sentences for specific claims:**

```markdown
Patient must be bed-confined or room-confined *(Under Review - High Confidence)* and physically unable to utilize commode or regular toilet facilities.
```

### Markdown Tagging Examples by Section

#### Clinical Overview:
```markdown
## Clinical Overview

A standard commode is for patients confined to a single room or level without toilet facilities. This is **rarely covered** *(Under Review - High Confidence)* due to strict confinement requirements. Patients who can ambulate to bathroom should use regular toilet facilities.
```

#### Coverage Details:
```markdown
### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient is confined to room, level, or home without toilet facilities
- Physically incapable of using regular toilet
- Medical necessity for toileting equipment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Detailed Written Order (DWO) required
- Must document confinement status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face encounter within 6 months *(Under Review)*
- Proof of delivery required
```

#### Tips for Approval:
```markdown
## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Be very specific about confinement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Best case scenario for approval: *(Under Review)*
  - Patient confined to one level (upstairs bedroom) without toilet on that level
  - Patient has severe arthritis preventing stair climbing
- Include detailed explanation of living situation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
```

#### Common Denial Reasons:
```markdown
## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient not sufficiently confined. Fix: Document specific confinement with medical reason. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Patient ambulatory"** - Patient can walk to bathroom. Fix: Explain why distance/stairs/barriers prevent toilet access even though patient can walk short distances. *(Under Review)*
```

### Comprehensive Field Notes for Narrative

All narrative tags must have corresponding entries in `data_quality.field_notes`:

```yaml
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    # YAML frontmatter notes
    prior_auth_medicare: "Not mentioned in source; inferred from absence (typical for standard DME)"

    # Narrative section notes
    narrative_frequency_claim: "Clinical Overview states 'typically 1 per 12 months' - inferred from standard replacement cycle, not explicit in source"
    narrative_confinement_requirement: "Coverage Details emphasize confinement requirement - synthesized from multiple source statements about room/level confinement"
    narrative_denial_reasons: "Common denial reasons section based on typical denial patterns for DME, not specific to this code in source"
    narrative_approval_tips: "Tips for Approval section based on general DME approval best practices, not code-specific guidance from source"
    narrative_best_practices: "Best practice recommendations inferred from typical clinical documentation requirements"
```

### Legal Protection Rationale

The catalog will include a disclaimer stating:
> "Coverage information populated via AI-assisted research and may contain inaccuracies. Fields marked *(Under Review)* or *(Under Review - High Confidence)* indicate inferred information that should be independently verified before prescribing."

**By tagging narrative content, we:**
1. Clearly disclose what's known vs. inferred
2. Protect prescribers by showing uncertainty
3. Reduce legal liability for incorrect coverage claims
4. Encourage independent verification of critical details

---

## üö´ Never Acceptable

The following practices are **strictly prohibited**:

1. **Making up data** - Never fabricate coverage criteria, diagnosis codes, or requirements
2. **Guessing at critical fields** without tagging:
   - Coverage (covered: true/false)
   - Prior authorization requirements
   - Billing modifiers
   - Frequency/quantity limits
3. **Copying from different codes** without verification (codes may differ)
4. **Removing uncertainty** - If unsure, mark it; don't hide uncertainty
5. **Mixing jurisdictions** - Don't assume Nassau = Brooklyn or Medicare = Medicaid

---

## üîç When to Search External Sources

**Use WebSearch/WebFetch selectively for:**

### ‚úÖ Appropriate Searches:
- **Verify discontinued codes**: "Is HCPCS code K0553 still active 2025?"
- **Confirm replacements**: "What replaced K0553 effective 2023?"
- **Check ICD-10 validity**: "Is R26.2 a valid ICD-10 code?"
- **Verify policy numbers**: "Medicare LCD L33736"
- **Confirm specific dates**: "When did NY Medicaid CGM policy change?"

### ‚ùå Avoid Searching For:
- Coverage criteria (too jurisdiction-specific, use source docs)
- Frequency limits (payer-specific, use source docs)
- Clinical indications (should be in research docs)
- Documentation requirements (complex, use source docs)
- "Filling gaps" in missing data (leads to mixed-source confusion)

### üéØ Search Protocol:
1. Search only for specific factual questions
2. Limit to 1-2 searches per code to avoid overload
3. Document search results in `source_documents` if used
4. Still apply 4-tier confidence system to searched data

---

## üìã Required Quality Metadata

Each file must include a `data_quality` section in YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
# Data Quality Tracking
data_quality:
  primary_source: "DM02, DM05, DM06.md (lines 47-56)"
  source_verified_fields: ["clinical_indications", "medicare.covered", "medicaid_nassau.covered", "prior_auth", "dvs_authorization"]
  high_confidence_fields: ["some_icd10_codes", "frequency_limit_wording"]
  needs_verification: ["quantity_limit", "requires_specialty_eval", "face_to_face"]
  external_searches: []  # List any web searches performed
  field_notes:
    icd10_r26_2: "Logically related to mobility issues mentioned in source; standard code for difficulty walking"
    frequency_limit: "Source says '5-year reasonable useful lifetime' - inferred standard frequency wording"
    quantity_limit: "Not explicitly stated in source; typical pattern for this type of equipment"
    face_to_face: "Not specified in source document; requires payer verification"
  last_verified: "2025-10-29"
  verified_by: "Claude Code"
```

**Field Definitions:**

- `primary_source`: Main research document(s) used, with specific line numbers
- `source_verified_fields`: Fields directly from source (Tier 1 - no tags)
- `high_confidence_fields`: Fields using (Under Review - High Confidence) tag (Tier 2)
- `needs_verification`: Fields using (Under Review) tag (Tier 3) or blank (Tier 4)
- `external_searches`: Any web searches conducted, with URLs
- `field_notes`: Detailed explanations for tagged fields - why inferred, what's uncertain, etc.
- `last_verified`: Date of last review
- `verified_by`: Who verified (human name or "Claude Code")

---

## ‚≠ê Best Practice: Detailed Field Notes

**The field_notes section is critical for transparency and future verification.** High-quality field_notes should include:

1. **Descriptive keys** - Name each note clearly (e.g., `medicare_requirements`, `clinical_criteria`, not just `note1`)
2. **Direct source quotes** - Include actual text from source documents when available
3. **Clear reasoning** - Explain WHY the inference was made and what evidence supports it
4. **Comprehensive coverage** - Document all major inferred fields and complex synthesis

### Example: Standard Field Notes (Acceptable)
```yaml
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    quantity_limit: "Not explicitly stated in source; typical pattern for this type of equipment"
    face_to_face: "Not specified in source document; requires payer verification"
```

### Example: Enhanced Field Notes (Excellent - E0784 Standard)

**This is the gold standard for field_notes documentation:**

```yaml
data_quality:
  primary_source: "DM13, DM14, DM15.md (lines 5-10)"
  source_verified_fields: ["covered", "prior_auth", "dvs_authorization", "documentation_type", "specialty_requirement", "mdi_trial_requirement"]
  high_confidence_fields: ["clinical_indications", "icd10_primary", "mdi_trial_duration", "cpeptide_requirement", "mandatory_followup"]
  needs_verification: ["face_to_face", "exact_rental_pricing", "requires_resna_atp"]
  external_searches: []
  field_notes:
    # Include direct source quotes with explanations
    medicare_requirements: "Source: 'SWO and WOPD required before dispensing; document comprehensive diabetes education completion, 6-month MDI trial with glucose logs ‚â•4 times/day, HbA1c, C-peptide and fasting glucose labs; physician treating multiple CSII patients working with diabetes care team; 3-month follow-up evaluations mandatory for continued coverage. LCD L33794, NCD 280.14.' - Direct quote shows all major requirements."

    medicaid_requirements: "Source: 'Prior authorization required via Magellan (877-309-9493) for non-preferred products; endocrinologist or experienced diabetes practitioner order required; document all eligibility criteria including 6-month MDI failure; DVS authorization per PDSP list; monthly rental with RR modifier.' - Comprehensive Medicaid requirements with specific contact info."

    # Explain synthesis and inference reasoning
    clinical_criteria: "Source: 'Type 1/Type 2 diabetes requiring intensive insulin management with ‚â•3 injections/day for ‚â•6 months AND one of: HbA1c >7%, recurring hypoglycemia, wide glucose fluctuations (>140 mg/dL pre-meal), dawn phenomenon (fasting >200 mg/dL), or severe glycemic excursions' - Multiple pathways documented, synthesized into clinical_indications list."

    # Document specific test requirements with source detail
    cpeptide_testing: "Source: 'Requires C-peptide ‚â§110% lower normal limit with fasting glucose ‚â§225 mg/dL OR beta cell autoantibody positive' - Biochemical confirmation requirement clearly stated. Both C-peptide threshold and fasting glucose threshold explicit."

    # Explain what's NOT in source but inferred
    face_to_face: "Not explicitly mentioned in source for supplies. Face-to-face typically required for pump (E0784) authorization but not clearly stated for supply refills. Marked 'Under Review' pending verification."

    # Document policy references and their significance
    medicare_policy_references: "Source cites LCD L33794 (Noridian DME MAC) and NCD 280.14 (National Coverage Determination). These are authoritative sources - coverage criteria directly from Medicare policy."
  last_verified: "2025-10-30"
  verified_by: "Claude Code"
```

### Why This Standard is Better

**The enhanced field_notes approach (E0784 standard) provides:**

1. **Transparency** - Future reviewers can see exactly what source said and how it was interpreted
2. **Verifiability** - Direct quotes make it easy to cross-check against source documents
3. **Reasoning** - Clear explanation of synthesis (e.g., "Multiple pathways documented, synthesized into list")
4. **Completeness** - Documents both what IS in source and what ISN'T but was inferred
5. **Policy context** - Notes authoritative references (LCD, NCD) and their significance
6. **Contact information** - Preserves specific phone numbers, policy numbers from source
7. **Maintenance-friendly** - Future editors can quickly understand decisions without re-reading entire source

### When to Use Enhanced vs. Standard Field Notes

**Use Enhanced Field Notes (E0784 Standard) for:**
- Complex items with multiple requirements (insulin pumps, power wheelchairs, complex DME)
- Items requiring prior authorization
- Items with strict clinical criteria (C-peptide tests, 6-month trials, etc.)
- Items with multiple payers having different requirements
- Categories with high denial rates where documentation details matter

**Standard Field Notes are acceptable for:**
- Simple, straightforward items (basic DME, standard supplies)
- Items with minimal coverage criteria
- Accessories and supplies with clear coverage patterns
- Items where source documentation is brief and straightforward

### Field Notes Organization

**Organize field_notes by topic using clear descriptive keys:**

```yaml
field_notes:
  # Medicare coverage - use "medicare_" prefix
  medicare_requirements: "Source quote and explanation..."
  medicare_documentation: "Specific documentation needs..."
  medicare_policy_references: "LCD/NCD citations..."

  # Medicaid coverage - use "medicaid_" prefix
  medicaid_requirements: "Source quote and explanation..."
  medicaid_authorization: "PA and DVS details..."
  medicaid_contact_info: "Phone numbers, websites..."

  # Clinical criteria - use "clinical_" prefix
  clinical_criteria: "Clinical indications synthesis..."
  clinical_testing: "Lab test requirements..."

  # ICD-10 codes - use "icd10_" prefix
  icd10_primary_codes: "How primary codes were selected..."
  icd10_specific_code: "Why S72.xxx included..."

  # Inferred fields - note what's NOT in source
  face_to_face: "Not mentioned in source; typical pattern..."
  quantity_limit: "Not explicit; inferred from equipment type..."

  # Narrative sections - use "narrative_" prefix
  narrative_approval_tips: "Tips section based on best practices..."
  narrative_denial_reasons: "Common denials inferred from patterns..."
```

**Key Naming Conventions:**
- Use descriptive names: `medicare_requirements` not `note1`
- Use prefixes for organization: `medicare_`, `medicaid_`, `clinical_`, `icd10_`, `narrative_`
- Be specific: `cpeptide_testing` not just `testing`
- Indicate content type: `_requirements`, `_documentation`, `_policy_references`, `_contact_info`

## üîÑ Review Process

### Initial Creation:
1. Read source document(s) thoroughly
2. Extract Tier 1 data (direct statements)
3. Identify Tier 2 data (clear inferences) and tag
4. Mark Tier 3 data (guesses) with (Under Review)
5. Leave Tier 4 data (unknown) blank
6. Complete `data_quality` section

### Before Committing:
- [ ] All critical fields (covered, prior_auth) are Tier 1 or 2
- [ ] All high confidence inferences tagged with (Under Review - High Confidence)
- [ ] All educated guesses tagged with (Under Review) or left blank
- [ ] `data_quality` section completed with field_notes for tagged fields
- [ ] Source document referenced with line numbers

### Periodic Review (Human):
- Review all (Under Review) fields
- Verify all (Under Review - High Confidence) fields
- Fill blanks with additional research
- Update `last_verified` and `verified_by`

---

## üìù Tagging Examples

### In YAML Frontmatter:

**CRITICAL: Tags must be IN the value string, not in YAML comments!**

```yaml
medicare:
  covered: true  # Tier 1: No tag needed (explicit in source)
  prior_auth: "false (Under Review - High Confidence)"  # Convert boolean to string with tag
  frequency_limit: "Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime) (Under Review - High Confidence)"
  quantity_limit: "1 per patient (Under Review)"
  special_notes: "KX modifier required when criteria met"  # Tier 1: No tag

icd10_primary:
  - "Z99.3 - Dependence on wheelchair (Under Review - High Confidence)"
  - "R26.2 - Difficulty in walking (Under Review - High Confidence)"

# Explanations go in field_notes
data_quality:
  field_notes:
    prior_auth: "Not mentioned in source document; inferred from absence which is typical for standard DME"
    frequency_limit: "Source says '5-year reasonable useful lifetime' - inferred standard frequency wording"
    quantity_limit: "Not explicitly stated in source; typical pattern for this type of equipment"
    icd10_codes: "Logically related to mobility issues mentioned in source; standard codes for conditions"
```

### In Markdown Narrative:
```markdown
**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient confined to single room
- Physically incapable of using regular toilet

**Important Notes:**
- Typically limited to 1 per 12 months (Under Review)
```

---

## üéØ Critical vs. Non-Critical Fields

### Critical Fields (Must be Tier 1 or 2 only):
- `covered` (true/false)
- `prior_auth` (true/false)
- `dvs_authorization` (true/false)
- `modifiers` (billing codes)
- Clinical indications (primary list)
- Coverage requirements (basic criteria)

**Rationale:** These directly affect billing and prescribing decisions. Errors here cause claim denials or compliance issues.

### Non-Critical Fields (Can be Tier 3-4):
- `requires_specialty_eval` (nice to know, not billing-critical)
- `requires_resna_atp` (informational)
- Extended ICD-10 lists beyond primary codes
- Related codes (helpful but not essential)
- Some special notes (context, not requirements)

**Rationale:** These provide helpful context but won't cause billing errors if missing or approximate.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Special Cases

### "Verify Code Availability" Pattern:
When source says "Verify code availability with NY Medicaid":
```yaml
medicaid_nassau:
  covered: "true (Under Review)"  # Convert to string with tag
  special_notes: "VERIFY code availability with NYRx (518) 486-3209 before prescribing"

data_quality:
  field_notes:
    medicaid_covered: "Source says verify availability - uncertain if code is in active fee schedule"
```

### Discontinued Codes:
```yaml
discontinued: true
special_notes: "CODE DISCONTINUED 1/1/2023 - Replaced by A4239"
medicare:
  covered: false
  special_notes: "Claims submitted after 1/1/2023 denied. Use A4239 instead."
```

### "Same as [CODE]" Pattern:
When source says "Same as E0163":
```yaml
# Reference the other code - append tags to string values
clinical_indications:
  - "Same as E0163 (Under Review - High Confidence)"
special_notes: "See E0163 for base coverage criteria (Under Review - High Confidence)"

data_quality:
  field_notes:
    clinical_indications: "Source states 'same as E0163' - inferred complete criteria from E0163 documentation"
```

But still complete the full details by referencing E0163's data.

---

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Source Citations:
Always include specific references in files:
```markdown
## References

- Medicare LCD L33736 (DME & Surgical Dressings)
- NY Medicaid DME Manual (effective 10/1/2025)
- Source document: DM02, DM05, DM06.md (lines 45-56)
```

### Uncertainty Language:
Be explicit about uncertainty in narrative sections:
- "Typically limited to..." (indicates pattern, not certainty)
- "Generally requires..." (common but not universal)
- "May require..." (possible, not definite)
- "Verify with payer..." (definitely check before assuming)

---

## ‚≠ê E0784 Comprehensive Standard (GOLD STANDARD)

**All files should meet or exceed the E0784.md standard for completeness and usefulness.**

The following files represent **GOLD STANDARD** examples for reference file quality. All future files should strive to match this level of comprehensiveness and practical utility.

### Gold Standard Examples

**Primary Reference:**
- **`clinical-coverage-reference/items/DM13/E0784.md`** - External Ambulatory Insulin Infusion Pump
  - THE benchmark for complex devices requiring prior authorization
  - Demonstrates all 7 comprehensive narrative sections
  - Exceptional field_notes with direct source quotes

**Additional Exemplary Files:**
- **`clinical-coverage-reference/items/M07/K0013.md`** - Custom Power Wheelchair
  - Excellent for complex devices with specialty evaluation requirements (RESNA ATP)
  - Demonstrates ADMC guidance and custom vs modular justification
  - Shows how to document "why modular inadequate" for custom approvals

- **`clinical-coverage-reference/items/M06/K0006.md`** - Heavy Duty Manual Wheelchair
  - Excellent for items with multiple coverage pathways (Weight/Spasticity/Measurements)
  - Shows clear differentiation between related codes (K0001‚ÜíK0006‚ÜíK0007 progression)
  - Demonstrates how to present three distinct qualification routes

- **`clinical-coverage-reference/items/DM05/E2103.md`** - Non-Adjunctive (Therapeutic) CGM Receiver

### When to Use Gold Standard vs. Minimum

**ALWAYS use Gold Standard (E0784 level) for:**
- ‚ùó Items requiring prior authorization
- ‚ùó Items with complex clinical criteria (multi-step requirements, lab tests, trials)
- ‚ùó Items with high denial rates
- ‚ùó Expensive items (>$1000)
- ‚ùó Items with strict documentation requirements
- ‚ùó Items physicians frequently ask about
- ‚ùó Items with payer-specific differences in coverage

**Minimum standard acceptable for:**
- ‚úì Very simple replacement parts (e.g., single footplate, standard battery)
- ‚úì Items with straightforward "replacement only" criteria and no other complexity
- ‚úì Items rarely prescribed
- ‚úì Items with minimal documentation (1-2 lines in source)

**Rule of Thumb:** If a physician might have questions about coverage, use Gold Standard. If in doubt, use Gold Standard.

### How to Achieve E0784 Standard

**Step 1: Read Source Thoroughly**
- Read entire source section for the code (don't just extract bullet points)
- Note ALL requirements, not just primary ones
- Identify common scenarios, exceptions, and special cases

**Step 2: Extract to YAML (Required)**
- Complete all required YAML fields per template
- Add comprehensive field_notes with source quotes
- Tag all inferred data appropriately

**Step 3: Write Comprehensive Narrative (Gold Standard)**

**Clinical Overview:**
```markdown
## Clinical Overview

[Item name] represents a [detailed description of what it is]. This [type]
[explains how it works or is used] for patients with [conditions].

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** [Any major restrictions or requirements]
*(Under Review - High Confidence)*

[Additional context about when/why used, technical details if relevant]
```

**Coverage Details:**
```markdown
### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements - ALL Must Be Met:**

1. **[Requirement category]:** [Specific requirement] *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **[Second requirement]:** [Details] *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **[Third requirement]:** [Details] *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **[Doc type required]** - [Details]
- [Additional documentation needs]
- [Lab tests, evaluations, etc.]

**Important Notes:**

- [Critical billing or coverage information]
- [Policy references: LCD L#####, NCD ###.##]
```

**Prescription Checklist:**
```markdown
## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] HCPCS code: "[CODE] - [Description]"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code ([list codes])

- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] [Medicare-specific requirements]

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] [Medicaid-specific requirements]
```

**Common Denial Reasons:**
```markdown
## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"[Exact denial reason in quotes]"** - [What this means]. Fix: [Specific
   actionable solution] *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"[Second denial]"** - [Explanation]. Fix: [Solution] *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

[Continue numbering...]
```

**Tips for Approval:**
```markdown
## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- [Specific tip] *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [Another tip with details]
- [Contact info if relevant]

**Medicaid:**
- [Medicaid-specific tips]
- [Authorization process details]
```

**Related Codes:**
```markdown
## Related Codes

- **[CODE]** - [Description] - [Relationship to current code]
- **[CODE]** - [Description] - [When to use instead/in addition]
```

**References:**
```markdown
## References

- Medicare LCD L##### ([MAC name] - Jurisdiction X)
- Medicare NCD ###.## ([Topic])
- [State] Medicaid: [Contact info if relevant]
- Source document: [filename] (lines X-Y)
```

### Quality Check: Does Your File Meet E0784 Standard?

**Ask yourself:**
- [ ] Could a physician use this file alone to determine if their patient qualifies?
- [ ] Are the most common denial reasons documented with solutions?
- [ ] Could office staff use the checklist to prepare the prescription?
- [ ] Would this file prevent common billing errors?
- [ ] Does it answer "when to use this code vs. related codes"?
- [ ] Are policy references included for verification?

**If you answered NO to any question:** Add more detail to reach E0784 standard.

**Remember:** These files will be the primary reference for busy physicians and facility staff. Comprehensive, actionable guidance prevents denials and improves patient access to needed equipment.

## üîÑ Version Control

This policy may evolve. When updating:

1. Update version number
2. Document changes in git commit
3. Review existing files for compliance with new standards
4. Update `HANDOFF_PROMPT.md` with policy changes

**Version History:**
- **1.4** (2025-10-30): Added E0784 Comprehensive Standard (Gold Standard) section - codifies DM13/E0784.md as the quality benchmark for all files. Distinguishes minimum policy compliance from gold standard for physician utility.
- **1.3** (2025-10-29): CRITICAL FIX - Tags must be in string values, not YAML comments (comments aren't parsed for HTML)
- **1.2** (2025-10-29): Added comprehensive narrative Markdown tagging guidance for legal protection
- **1.1** (2025-10-29): Simplified tagging system - only (Under Review - High Confidence) and (Under Review) inline
- **1.0** (2025-10-29): Initial policy

## ‚úÖ Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing new reference files:

**YAML Frontmatter:**
- [ ] Read source document(s) completely
- [ ] All data classified by tier (1-4)
- [ ] Tier 2 fields tagged with (Under Review - High Confidence)
- [ ] Tier 3 fields tagged with (Under Review) or blank
- [ ] Tier 4 fields left blank with verification note
- [ ] Critical fields are Tier 1 or 2 only
- [ ] Tags only contain (Under Review - High Confidence) or (Under Review) - no other inline explanations

**Narrative Markdown Content:**
