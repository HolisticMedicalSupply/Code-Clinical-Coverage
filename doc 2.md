## S04: LYMPHEDEMA COMPRESSION (110 codes)

**IMPORTANT:** Medicare Jurisdiction for NY is **K (NGS)**, NOT E/Novitas. However, all DME MACs follow same national CMS policy for lymphedema compression under Lymphedema Treatment Act (effective January 1, 2024).

**Covered Diagnosis:** **I89.0** (lymphedema NEC), **Q82.0** (hereditary lymphedema - primary), **I97.2** (postmastectomy lymphedema syndrome), **I97.89** (other postprocedural complications). Note: Lymphedema diagnosis REQUIRED. Breast cancer diagnosis alone (C50.x) without lymphedema does NOT qualify.

- Accessories: A6593 (donning/doffing aids, accessories NOS - requires narrative). Includes: zippers, linings, padding, fillers, donning gloves, foot slippers, stocking butlers. Must be medically necessary for effective use. Example: liner to prevent skin breakdown from garment friction.

**COMPRESSION LEVEL SELECTION:**

- Class I (18-30 mmHg): Early/mild lymphedema (Stage 1), maintenance after reduction, post-surgical prophylaxis
- Class II (30-40 mmHg): Moderate lymphedema (Stage 2), most common prescription level, after intensive therapy
- Class III (40-50+ mmHg): Severe/advanced lymphedema (Stage 2-3), fibrotic tissue changes. Requires documentation of medical necessity for higher compression. May require custom garments for adequate pressure gradient.
- Gradient vs. non-gradient: All covered codes specify GRADIENT compression (higher pressure distally, decreasing proximally). Non-gradient wraps NOT covered.

**DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:** (1) Diagnosis: one of covered ICD-10 codes, (2) Stage/phase of lymphedema: document severity, (3) Duration of treatment/need: expected length, (4) Anatomical location(s): which limb(s)/body areas, (5) Type, description, quantity: specific garments needed, (6) **Measurements for compression garments:** Lower extremity: ankle, calf, knee (for below-knee); add thigh for thigh-high. Upper extremity: wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm, axilla. Measurements in centimeters, taken in morning when limb smallest. Document anatomical landmarks used. (7) Frequency of replacement: 3 daytime/6 months; 2 nighttime/2 years, (8) Compression level justification: why specific mmHg selected, (9) Custom vs. OTS rationale: for custom, document significant circumference discrepancy (proximal vs. distal), skin folds/contours requiring specialized knitting, fabric intolerance to standard, failed trial of standard sizing, (10) Prescribing practitioner: name, MMIS ID, signature, date.

**Prescription Requirements:** Signed by physician, PA, NP, or CNS (as authorized by state law). Must specify: diagnosis code, garment type, compression level, quantity, affected limb (RT/LT). Valid prescription dated before date of service.

**REPLACEMENT FREQUENCY:**

- Standard replacement: Daytime 3 per body area every 6 months; Nighttime 2 per body area every 24 months
- Early replacement (lost/stolen/damaged): If 1 garment lost/damaged, can get 3 replacements (daytime) or 2 (nighttime) BUT frequency clock RESTARTS from replacement DOS. Requires **RA modifier** + narrative explaining reason.
- Change in limb size: New garments covered if measurements change requiring different size. Document new measurements and reason. Frequency clock restarts.

**BILLING REQUIREMENTS:**

- Modifiers: **RT** (right) / **LT** (left) - REQUIRED for all codes with laterality. Bill bilateral items on SEPARATE claim lines with RT and LT (not RTLT on same line). 1 unit per claim line. Claims without proper modifiers will REJECT.
- Miscellaneous codes requiring narrative: A6519, A6549, A6584, A6593, A6609 require narrative in electronic claim NTE 2300 or NTE 2400 loop, paper claim Item 19. Narrative must include: description of item (quantity per unit for supplies), manufacturer name, product name/model name and number, Supplier Price List (PL) amount (usual/customary charge), HCPCS of related item (if applicable).
- Supplier requirements: Must be enrolled Medicare DMEPOS supplier. Responsible for: measurements, fitting, donning/doffing training, garment maintenance education. Payment includes ALL fitting/measurement services (bundled).
- Beneficiary cost-sharing: 20% coinsurance after Part B deductible ($257 in 2025). Payment = 80% of lesser of actual charge or national payment amount.

**PRIOR AUTHORIZATION:** Medicare: NO routine PA required for lymphedema compression garments. Exception: may require PA for unusual quantities or frequency beyond standard limits. Audits: Post-payment review possible. Must maintain all documentation for MAC audit.

**NY MEDICAID:** Legal background: Davis v. Shah (821 F.3d 231) - federal court permanently enjoined NY DOH from enforcing restrictive benefit limits. NY Medicaid regulations (18 NYCRR § 505.5) amended following court order. Compression stockings must be covered when medically necessary, not limited to specific diagnoses. Coverage criteria: medical necessity documented by prescribing physician. Coverage for lymphedema and other clinically significant conditions. Not limited to venous stasis ulcers only (pre-2016 limitation removed). Prior authorization may be required - check current eMedNY requirements. Documentation: use eMedNY Form 361501 or ePACES system. Include: diagnosis code(s), medical necessity documentation, prescription, measurements. Prescriber must have valid NY Medicaid provider number or license number. Supplier must be enrolled NY Medicaid DME provider. Contact: eMedNY Provider Line (800) 522-5518 or (518) 447-9860. Website: www.emedny.org.

**POST-MASTECTOMY CONSIDERATIONS:** WHCRA (Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act): covers post-mastectomy prostheses and treatment of complications (including lymphedema). Lymphedema compression is NOT a prosthetic benefit - it's DME benefit under lymphedema diagnosis. Must bill with I97.2 (postmastectomy lymphedema) or other lymphedema diagnosis. Breast cancer code (C50.x) alone insufficient. Coverage path: Medicare Part B DMEPOS benefit (not prosthetics). Requires lymphedema diagnosis, NOT just mastectomy history.

**KEY CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION TIPS:** (1) Measurements CRITICAL for coverage - take in morning when swelling minimal, use consistent anatomical landmarks, document circumferential measurements in cm, measure bilaterally even if only one limb affected (for comparison). (2) Compression level justification: Stage 1 consider 18-30 mmHg; Stage 2 typically 30-40 mmHg; Stage 3 with fibrosis may require 40-50+ mmHg. Document response to previous compression levels. Note tissue texture (soft, pitting, non-pitting, fibrotic). (3) Custom vs. standard determination: Try standard sizing first when possible (less expensive). Document specific reason standard inadequate. Custom requires: unusual limb shape, extreme size discrepancy, unique anatomical needs. (4) Phase of treatment: Intensive/decongestion phase: bandaging systems (A6594-A6609). Maintenance phase: garments and wraps. Can use both if medically necessary at different treatment stages.

## SUMMARY: KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR PRESCRIPTION WRITING

**DOCUMENTATION ESSENTIALS (All Categories):**

1. **Standard Written Order** before delivery with specific item description, quantity, frequency
2. **ICD-10 diagnosis code(s)** supporting medical necessity
3. **Medical records** documenting: diagnosis, severity, duration, why item medically necessary, measurements (where applicable), failed alternatives, expected duration of need
4. **Face-to-face encounter** documented within 6 months (for power mobility, select orthoses, osteogenesis stimulators - NOT for manual wheelchairs, canes, walkers)
5. **Prior authorization** obtained when required (varies by payer and item)

**COMMON DENIAL PREVENTION:**

- Missing/incomplete documentation (82.4% of surgical dressing denials)
- Lack of medical necessity justification
- Insufficient trial periods (TENS 30-60 days, pneumatic compression 4-6 months conservative therapy)
- Missing measurements (lymphedema, wheelchairs, pressure ulcer staging)
- Quantities exceeding limits without justification
- Using non-covered materials (silver, honey, charcoal in dressings)
- Wrong diagnosis codes (breast cancer alone doesn't qualify for lymphedema garments)

**MODIFIERS CRITICAL FOR PAYMENT:**

- **KX**: Coverage criteria met (required for many DME items)
- **RT/LT**: Right/left laterality (required for bilateral items - bill separately)
- **A1-A9**: Number of wounds (surgical dressings)
- **AW**: Item furnished with surgical dressing (tape, compression wrap)
- **KF**: Class III device (osteogenesis stimulators)
- **BA**: Enteral nutrition (when using IV pole for enteral)
- **AU**: Item furnished with urological supplies (tape, saline)

**NY MEDICAID SPECIFIC:**

- **DVS (Dispensing Validation System)** required for items marked with # in procedure manual
- **Prior approval** required for underlined items in manual
- **Direct bill** for items without # or underline
- Contact beneficiary for refills; document affirmative response
- 180-day authorization period for DME/dressings; 5-day for medical supplies

**MEDICARE IMPROPER PAYMENT FOCUS AREAS:**

- Surgical dressings (67.3% improper payment rate)
- Pneumatic compression devices (78.9% improper payment rate in 2023)
- Power wheelchairs (extensive PA requirements)
- TENS units (trial period documentation)
- Continuous glucose monitors (5 criteria must ALL be met)
