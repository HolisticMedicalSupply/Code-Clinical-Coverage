# M06A Enhancement Plan: Minimum → Gold Standard

**Status:** 74 files at minimum compliance need enhancement to E0784 Gold Standard
**Category:** M06A - Manual Wheelchair Accessories
**Current State:** Complete YAML (v1.3 compliant) but minimal narrative sections
**Goal:** Add comprehensive narrative sections matching E0784/K0013/K0006 standard

---

## Overview

### Why This Matters
- 2nd largest category (74 files)
- Frequently prescribed manual wheelchair accessories
- High denial rates without proper documentation guidance
- Items require medical necessity justification (not just "included in base")
- Complex bundling rules need clear explanation

### Enhancement Scope
Each file needs addition of:
1. ✅ Expanded Clinical Overview (currently 1-2 sentences → 2-3 paragraphs)
2. ✅ Prescription Checklist for Physicians (currently absent)
3. ✅ Common Denial Reasons with fixes (currently absent)
4. ✅ Tips for Approval organized by payer (currently absent)
5. ✅ Related Codes with descriptions (currently absent)
6. ✅ Enhanced References with LCD numbers (currently basic)

**YAML is already complete** - No changes needed to frontmatter.

1. Batch 1 (Positioning Accessories) - 7 files - Complex medical necessity
2. Batch 7 (Specialized Systems) - 7 files - Mandatory specialty eval requirements
3. Batch 10 (Seat Height & Wheels) - 7 files - K0056 very complex

**Rationale:** These have highest denial rates, most complex requirements, PA needed

### **Phase 2: Medium Priority (35 files, ~52.5 hours)**
4. Batch 2 (Upholstery & Positioning) - 7 files
5. Batch 3 (Specialized Positioning) - 7 files
6. Batch 8 (Armrests & Footrests Part 1) - 7 files
7. Batch 9 (Footrest Components) - 7 files
8. Batch 11 (Final Two) - 2 files
