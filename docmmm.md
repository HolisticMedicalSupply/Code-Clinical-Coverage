### **E0787 - External ambulatory infusion pump, insulin, with therapeutic CGM integration**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:** **CODE INVALID FOR MEDICARE BILLING EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 15, 2020.** CMS determined integrated pumps should be coded separately: E0784RR (insulin pump rental) + K0554RR (CGM receiver rental) OR E0784RR + E2102RR (adjunctive CGM). Previously submitted E0787 claims can be corrected using separate component codes.

**Medicare Reimbursement:** **DISCONTINUED - DO NOT USE.** Any combination of E0787 and E0784 rental payments count toward 13-month cap if previously billed. For integrated pump/CGM systems, bill pump (E0784RR) and CGM components separately per current CMS coding requirements.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:** **E0787 not separately billable - follows Medicare coding.** For integrated pump/CGM systems under Preferred Diabetic Supply Program (PDSP): use separate codes for pump (E0784) and CGM components.
