## BOC CODE: OR04 - PENILE PUMPS

### **L7900 - Male Vacuum Erection System**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:** This code is NOT COVERED by Medicare as of July 1, 2015. Section 203 of the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act of 2014 mandated that vacuum erection devices be treated as statutorily non-covered items, similar to erectile dysfunction drugs excluded under Medicare Part D. No clinical criteria exist because coverage is prohibited by federal statute regardless of medical necessity.

**Medicare Reimbursement:** Claims submitted with code L7900 for dates of service on or after July 1, 2015 are automatically denied as non-covered with no benefit available. No prior authorization pathway exists. No reimbursement is available under any circumstances for erectile dysfunction indication.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:** NOT COVERED for erectile dysfunction or sexual dysfunction treatment per Chapter 645 of the Laws of 2005, which prohibits NYS Medicaid coverage of drugs, supplies, or procedures used for treatment of sexual dysfunction or erectile dysfunction. A very limited exception exists in the inpatient setting only if the device is used for a condition OTHER than sexual or erectile dysfunction for which it has FDA approval, but this requires prior medical review by NYS Department of Health and extensive documentation demonstrating non-ED/SD use.

**NY Medicaid Reimbursement:** No reimbursement available for erectile dysfunction purposes. Absolutely not covered for individuals required to register as sex offenders under state law. Providers must verify through the Health Commerce System Erectile Dysfunction Verification System that patients are not registered sex offenders before providing any SD/ED-related services. The limited inpatient exception requires prior approval from the Bureau of Medical Review at (800) 342-3005 for Fee-for-Service or from the patient's Medicaid Managed Care Plan with documentation that clearly establishes non-ED/SD indication.

---

### **L7902 - Tension Ring for Vacuum Erection Device**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:** NOT COVERED by Medicare effective July 1, 2015 due to the same statutory exclusion under Section 203 of the ABLE Act of 2014. Accessories for vacuum erection devices are excluded in the same manner as the primary devices themselves. No clinical criteria apply as coverage is prohibited by federal statute.

**Medicare Reimbursement:** Claims are automatically denied as non-covered. No reimbursement pathway exists. No prior authorization option available. Patients must pay 100% out-of-pocket for this accessory if they wish to obtain it.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:** NOT COVERED for erectile dysfunction treatment per Chapter 645 of the Laws of 2005. The same limited inpatient exception may apply only if used for FDA-approved non-ED/SD conditions, requiring prior medical review by NYS Department of Health with extensive documentation.

**NY Medicaid Reimbursement:** No reimbursement for erectile dysfunction or sexual dysfunction purposes. Same restrictions apply regarding sex offender registry verification. Any exception requires prior approval with clear documentation of non-ED/SD medical necessity. Standard outpatient prescriptions for erectile dysfunction will be denied.

## BOC CODE: PD04 - NEUROSTIMULATORS AND/OR SUPPLIES

### **E0766 - Electrical Stimulation Device for Cancer Treatment**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:** E0766 is specifically for Tumor Treatment Field Therapy (TTFT/Optune device) for glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer, NOT for osteogenesis stimulation. Coverage is limited to newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme in adult patients 22 years or older following maximal debulking surgery and completion of radiation therapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy. Patients must have Karnofsky Performance Status of 60 or higher (or ECOG Performance Status of 2 or better) and must initiate TTFT within 7 weeks from the last dose of concomitant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, whichever is later. The device must be used in combination with maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy and patients must be counseled that the device requires wearing at least 18 hours daily for effectiveness. Coverage is explicitly NOT available for recurrent glioblastoma per Local Coverage Determination L34823 from Noridian despite FDA approval for this indication.

**Medicare Reimbursement:** Prior authorization is REQUIRED since July 1, 2021 and must be obtained from Noridian Healthcare Solutions (DME MAC for New York/Jurisdiction D). Documentation must include histological confirmation of GBM diagnosis, surgical records documenting maximal debulking surgery completion, radiation therapy completion documentation with dates, chemotherapy records showing completion of concomitant temozolomide with radiation, KPS score of 60 or higher documented by treating physician, timing documentation confirming TTFT initiation within the 7-week window, physician order for device with medical necessity justification, and patient counseling documentation regarding the 18-plus hour daily wear requirement. For continued coverage beyond the initial 3 months, re-evaluation is required at 60-91 days with MRI documentation showing no disease progression, continued temozolomide maintenance therapy, documentation of device compliance showing at least 18 hours per day usage, and maintained KPS of 60 or higher. The device contains objective usage logs tracking compliance and non-compliance may result in coverage termination.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:** NYS Medicaid does not have a published specific policy for E0766 in the eMedNY manuals, but managed care plans have provided coverage on a case-by-case basis. For newly diagnosed GBM, expected criteria include adult patients 22 years or older with histologically-confirmed supratentorial GBM who have completed surgical debulking, radiation, and concurrent chemotherapy with KPS of 60 or higher or ECOG of 2 or better, and who will use the device with maintenance temozolomide. For recurrent GBM, while Medicare categorically denies coverage, NYS Medicaid managed care appeals have succeeded based on FDA approval for recurrent indication, NCCN Category 2B recommendation, and medical necessity when patients refuse further chemotherapy with the device serving as monotherapy alternative. External appeal decisions indicate case-by-case review is possible.

**NY Medicaid Reimbursement:** Prior approval IS REQUIRED for E0766 as it is an underlined code in the DMEPOS manual. Submit via eMedNY ePACES online portal or Prior Approval Form (eMedNY 361502) faxed to the DME Prior Authorization unit with code designation 'A1' for DME prior approval requests. Required documentation includes physician prescription or order with medical necessity justification, diagnosis documentation with pathology report confirming GBM and imaging reports (MRI), treatment history including surgical reports, radiation therapy completion records, and chemotherapy records, performance status documentation with KPS or ECOG scores, failed treatments or contraindications to alternative therapies especially for recurrent cases, and patient counseling documentation regarding device use. Authorization is valid for a specified time period typically not exceeding 6 months. E0766 is billed monthly as rental or maintenance, with accessories (A4555 replacement electrodes/transducer arrays) billed as needed for replacement typically 1-2 times per week. For Medicaid managed care members, contact the specific MCO for authorization requirements. For dual-eligible beneficiaries with both Medicare and Medicaid, Medicare is the primary payer and NYS Medicaid would only cover Medicare copay or deductible amounts.
