**REQUIRED for Coverage (Medicare and NY Medicaid):**

- **I89.0** - Lymphedema, not elsewhere classified
- **I97.2** - Postmastectomy lymphedema syndrome
- **I97.89** - Other postprocedural complications of circulatory system
- **Q82.0** - Hereditary lymphedema

**CRITICAL:** Claims without lymphedema diagnosis WILL BE DENIED as non-covered. Chronic venous insufficiency alone (I87.2) does NOT qualify. Breast cancer diagnosis alone without lymphedema does NOT qualify.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

**Medicare vs. NY Medicaid Differences:**

- **Authorization:** Medicare no PA; NY Medicaid uses DVS real-time system
- **Co-payment:** Medicare 20% after deductible; NY Medicaid none
- **Frequency Coding:** NY uses F7 designation; Medicare describes as "every 6 months"
- **Reimbursement:** NY fee schedule often lower than Medicare

**Custom Garment Documentation:**

- Must justify why standard inadequate: significant circumference differences proximal-to-distal, skin folds requiring special knit, fabric intolerance
- Exact limb measurements at multiple points required
- Member medical record support

**Bilateral Billing:**

- MUST bill each side on separate lines
- Use 1 unit of service per line with RT or LT
- DO NOT use RTLT on same line with 2 units

**Fitting/Measurement:**

- Bundled into garment payment
- Not separately billable
- Supplier responsible even if external fitter used

**Replacement Guidelines:**

- Scheduled: 3 daytime per 6 months; 2 nighttime per 24 months
- Early: Use RA modifier + narrative for loss/theft/damage
- Medical change: Document limb size change or condition change
- Entire set replaced when one item lost; frequency clock restarts

**Cannot Bill Separately:**

- Bandaging supplies (A codes) on same date as CPT 29581/29584 therapy codes
- Fitting/measurement/education services

**NOC Codes:**

- Five codes require detailed narrative or claim denies as unprocessable
- Include: description, manufacturer, product name/model, price, related HCPCS

**Managed Care Note:**

- These policies apply to NY Medicaid Fee-For-Service
- Managed Care Organizations may have different requirements
- Verify member enrollment status before billing

## SUMMARY FOR QUICK REFERENCE

**Before Prescribing:**

1. Confirm qualifying diagnosis (wound: surgical/debrided; lymphedema: I89.0/I97.2/I97.89/Q82.0)
2. Document clinical criteria (wound characteristics/lymphedema stage)
3. Specify exact items, quantities, body parts
4. Include measurements for custom compression items
5. Indicate compression level (mmHg) and laterality (RT/LT)

**Prescription Must Include:**

- Patient demographics and insurance ID
- Specific diagnosis code
- Exact HCPCS description or code
- Quantity and size
- Frequency of use/change
- Body part and side (RT/LT)
- Length of need
- Signature and date

**Documentation to Support:**

- Wound: type, location, size (length × width × depth), stage, exudate level, dressing type/frequency
- Lymphedema: diagnosis, location, measurements, stage/severity, treatment history
- Medical necessity justification
- Custom items: why standard insufficient
- Monthly/ongoing assessments of progress

**Key Differences Medicare vs. NY Medicaid:**

- Authorization: Medicare none; NY Medicaid DVS for most
- Frequency: Medicare descriptive; NY Medicaid F7 codes
- Co-pay: Medicare 20%; NY Medicaid $1 (dressings) or none (lymphedema)
- Modifiers: Both require A1-A9 (dressings), RT/LT (compression); NY less strict on A1-A9

**Red Flags to Avoid:**

- Medicare: Silver dressings (not recognized), combining hydrating + absorptive on same wound
- Lymphedema: Claims without lymphedema diagnosis, CVI alone, missing RT/LT modifiers
- Both: Exceeding frequency limits without RA modifier, missing required narratives for NOC codes
