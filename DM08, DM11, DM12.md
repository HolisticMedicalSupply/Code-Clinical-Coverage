## Key Documentation Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare Standard Requirements:**

- Signed, dated physician order before billing (or submit with EY modifier)
- Medical record documentation: condition requiring device, history of other therapeutic modalities tried, physical exam findings
- Order must be filled within 365 days of order date

**NYS Medicaid Standard Requirements:**

- Fiscal order from licensed physician, PA, or NP (signed written or electronic)
- Valid diagnosis code matching medical necessity
- Documentation available for 6 years from payment date
- Delivery statement signed by member required
- DVS authorization required for items marked (#)
- Prior approval required for items marked underlined

**Best Practices:**

- **Standard electric heat pads (E0210/E0215)** have best coverage rates - document history of OTC heat/cold tried
- **Cold therapy pumps (E0218)** well-covered for post-surgical orthopedic cases - specify surgical procedure and expected duration
- **Water-circulating and heat lamp devices** have limited/no Medicare coverage - consider alternatives
- **Infusion pumps**: Drugs only covered as supplies to covered DME pump; KX modifier mandatory after 3/1/2023
- **Disposable infusion devices (A4305/A4306)** are NOT covered as DME

**Coverage Priorities:**

1. Document specific medical necessity for each device
2. Include history of treatments tried (PT, OTC modalities)
3. Specify expected duration of need
4. For Medicaid: Ensure diagnosis code supports medical necessity
5. Consider submitting prior approval requests for items with coverage uncertainty
