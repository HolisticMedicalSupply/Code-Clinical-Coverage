**General Documentation Best Practices:**

- Specific diagnosis with ICD-10 codes
- Medical necessity justification (why patient needs this vs alternatives)
- Length of need
- For pumps: document home environment suitable, patient/caregiver capability
- For insulin pumps: endocrinologist order, comprehensive diabetes education completed, glucose logs
- For rehab devices: PT/OT evaluation with functional limitations and treatment goals
