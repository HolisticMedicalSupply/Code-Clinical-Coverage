# Data Quality Tracking
# See DATA_INTEGRITY_POLICY.md v1.3 for tagging guidelines
# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Tags must be IN the string value, NOT in YAML comments!
# Comments (#) are not parsed and won't display in HTML
# IMPORTANT: Tags apply to BOTH YAML frontmatter AND narrative Markdown content
# Use (Under Review - High Confidence) for Tier 2 (high confidence inferences)
# Use (Under Review) for Tier 3 (educated guesses)
# No tag needed for Tier 1 (direct from source)
# Examples:
#   prior_auth: "false (Under Review - High Confidence)"  # Boolean as string with tag
#   frequency_limit: "Once every 5 years (Under Review - High Confidence)"  # String with tag appended
