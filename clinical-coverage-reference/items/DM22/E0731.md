# E0731 - Form-Fitting TENS/NMES Garment

## ⚠️ RARELY MEDICALLY NECESSARY - High Documentation Bar

## Clinical Overview
Form-fitting conductive garment for TENS/NMES delivery. Alternative to conventional electrodes when standard application not feasible.

**Coverage:** RARELY approved - requires strong justification

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes - RARELY medically necessary
**Requirements - Must document ONE of:**
1. Large area/multiple sites requiring frequent stimulation making standard electrodes infeasible
2. Sites inaccessible with conventional electrodes (e.g., back, hard-to-reach areas)
3. Skin condition contraindicating standard electrodes (contact dermatitis, adhesive allergy)

**Additional Requirements:**
- Physician prescription for covered TENS treatment
- Submit brand/model with claim
- **DENIED if criteria not met**

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - ONLY for knee OA (M17.0-M17.9) with strong justification
**Requirements:** Medicare criteria + knee OA diagnosis restriction
**Expect:** High level of scrutiny, likely to be challenged

## Prescribing Checklist
- [ ] **Document specific reason conventional electrodes inadequate**
- [ ] Skin condition diagnosis if applicable (L23.x, L24.x for dermatitis)
- [ ] Brand/model of garment specified
- [ ] Active covered TENS prescription on file
- [ ] For Medicaid: knee OA (M17.0-M17.9) diagnosis

## Tips
**Consider:** Standard electrodes first - garment only when truly necessary
**Documentation:** Photos of skin condition or detailed anatomical justification helpful
