**Billing:** E0157 is billed **"each"** - typically order 2 attachments for pair of crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

**Key Requirement:** Must document medical necessity for **BOTH** walker and crutches - explain clinical scenario requiring both mobility devices.

## Coverage Details

- Crutch attachment medically necessary for transporting crutches with walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Clinical scenario requires both mobility devices *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Requires covered base walker and covered crutches

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Must document use of both walker and crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain clinical scenario requiring both devices (e.g., walker at home, crutches for stairs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document medical necessity for mobility device flexibility *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Reference both walker and crutch prescriptions *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required

**Important Notes:**
- Subject to reasonable replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Requires covered walker AND covered crutches - attachment is accessory to both
- Billed "each" - typically 2 attachments for pair of crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must be medically necessary, not for convenience *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Crutch attachment for walker allowing crutch storage/transport with walker
- Each unit billed separately
- Member uses both walker and crutches requiring transport of crutches with walker
- Clinical scenario necessitates both mobility devices

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- Must document medical necessity for both mobility devices *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- Reference both walker and crutch fiscal orders *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency F7: Twice per year

**Important Notes:**
- Billed "each" (per attachment) - typically need 2 for pair of crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must document why patient needs both walker and crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- DVS authorization valid 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Explanation of clinical scenario requiring both devices *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Examples of when walker used vs. when crutches used *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Reference to both walker and crutch prescriptions *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document base walker meets MRADL criteria
- [ ] Document crutches meet LCD L33733 criteria (if applicable)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Explain clinical scenario - when does patient use walker vs. crutches? *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explain medical necessity for transporting crutches with walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] Reference both walker and crutch fiscal orders *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Document clinical scenarios requiring each device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explain need to transport crutches with walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Attachment described as convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: Document specific clinical scenario (e.g., "Patient uses walker indoors for stability, crutches for stairs and outdoor uneven terrain - needs to transport crutches to access different areas," or "Post-surgical recovery: uses walker initially upon waking when weaker, transitions to crutches as strength improves during day"). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Walker or crutches not covered"** - Attachment denied because base walker or crutches don't meet criteria. Fix: Ensure both walker and crutches meet respective coverage criteria. Reference both device prescriptions/orders. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"One device would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't establish why patient needs both devices. Fix: Explain why single device inadequate for patient's varied mobility needs. Document different scenarios requiring different levels of support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Insufficient documentation of dual device use"** - Use of both devices mentioned but not explained. Fix: Provide detailed explanation of when/why each device used. Include examples: "Walker for grocery shopping (needs stability, hands-free for cart), crutches for work (faster, more maneuverable in office)." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Convenience item"** - Perceived as non-medical enhancement. Fix: Document medical necessity - patient requires both devices for different functional scenarios, attachment enables appropriate device selection for safety. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on clinical scenarios requiring different mobility devices *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Be specific about when/why each device used (e.g., walker for indoor stability, crutches for outdoor mobility) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document variable mobility needs throughout day or in different environments *(Under Review)*
- PT/OT evaluation supporting need for multiple devices helpful *(Under Review)*
- Explain safety benefit - having crutches available when walker inappropriate for situation *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Document medical necessity for both walker and crutches clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide specific examples of dual device scenarios *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Reference both walker and crutch fiscal orders with dates *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F7 frequency allows replacement twice per year *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Typically need 2 attachments (one for each crutch) - document quantity needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Example Clinical Scenarios:**
- Post-hip replacement: Uses walker for indoor stability and bathroom safety, crutches for outdoor walking and stairs *(Under Review)*
- Bilateral knee arthritis: Uses walker for shopping (hands-free for cart, more stable), crutches for work (faster, more mobile in office) *(Under Review)*
- Chronic condition with variable symptoms: Uses walker on bad days for stability, crutches on good days for faster mobility *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes
