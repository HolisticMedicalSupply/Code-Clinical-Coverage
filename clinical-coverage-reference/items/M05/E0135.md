# E0135 - Folding Pickup Walker

## Clinical Overview

The E0135 is a folding version of the rigid pickup walker (E0130) - a walker without wheels that the patient must lift to advance, but with the added feature of folding for easier transport and storage. This is appropriate for patients who meet the same clinical criteria as E0130 but have transport or storage needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)* (e.g., frequent car trips, limited home storage space, travel needs).

**IMPORTANT:** The folding feature is for convenience, NOT a medical necessity difference *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Both E0130 and E0135 have identical clinical criteria and coverage requirements. Selection between folding vs. rigid is based on patient's storage/transport needs, not medical condition.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- Safe use capability - patient must demonstrate ability to lift and use walker safely
- Sufficient functional resolution - walker must improve patient's mobility
- Upper body strength adequate to repeatedly lift walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient cannot resolve mobility limitation with cane *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Same criteria as E0130 (rigid pickup walker)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- Must document MRADL impairment with specific examples *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- Prescription now supports medical necessity per Article A55426 (9/26/2024, retroactive to 1/1/2024)
- No additional documentation needed for folding feature vs. rigid *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- Folding vs. rigid selection based on transport/storage needs, not medical necessity
- Standard DME modifiers apply (NU/RR/UE/KH/KI/KJ)
- No cost difference between E0130 and E0135 from medical necessity perspective *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
- Inability to resolve mobility limitation with cane
- Sufficient upper extremity function to lift walker repeatedly
- Safe operation capability demonstrated *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Same criteria as E0130

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code) - valid for 180 days
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- Must document MRADL impairment and cane inadequacy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity strength assessment required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Length of Need determination required for rental vs. purchase decision
- Folding selection based on member storage/transport needs (not medical necessity) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Rental vs. Purchase Rules:**
- If Length of Need <10 months: Must rent (10% purchase price/month, max 10 months)
- If Length of Need ≥10 months: May rent or purchase at supplier/patient preference
- Frequency F2: Twice per lifetime only

**Important Notes:**
- Frequency F2 (twice per lifetime) is very restrictive - same as E0130
- Patient must demonstrate adequate upper body strength to lift walker
- DVS authorization expires after 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same rental/purchase rules and DVS authorization requirements apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) indicating mobility limitation
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Specific examples of how mobility limitation affects home activities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Documentation that cane insufficient for patient's mobility needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Upper extremity strength assessment (adequate to lift walker) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document safe use capability
- [ ] If specifying E0135 vs. E0130, may note transport/storage needs (optional) *(Under Review)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Length of Need estimate (for rental vs. purchase determination)
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] If specifying folding model, may note storage/transport needs *(Under Review)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient's mobility limitation not severe enough or not documented to impair MRADLs. Fix: Provide specific examples of how patient cannot safely perform toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, or bathing without walker support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Cane would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't explain why walker needed vs. cane. Fix: Document trial with cane showing inadequate support, or explain severity of balance/weakness requiring bilateral support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Patient cannot safely use"** - Concerns about patient's ability to lift walker or cognitive ability to use safely. Fix: Document demonstration of safe walker use, upper body strength assessment, cognitive evaluation if applicable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Upgraded walker paid at least costly alternative"** - Patient received wheeled or specialized walker without justification. Fix: If prescribing upgraded walker, document specific medical reason why pickup style inadequate. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Use same documentation approach as E0130 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Folding feature doesn't require additional medical justification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Focus on MRADL impairment and safe use capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If patient needs wheeled walker instead, explain why pick-up style inadequate (reduced endurance, difficulty lifting, etc.) *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Document upper extremity strength assessment showing adequate lifting capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide Length of Need estimate based on diagnosis and prognosis *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If temporary need, consider rental to avoid frequency limit issues *(Under Review)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Remember F2 frequency (twice per lifetime) is very restrictive *(Under Review)*
- Folding selection based on practical needs (e.g., "patient frequently travels to medical appointments requiring transport in vehicle") *(Under Review)*

- **E0141** - Rigid wheeled walker (for patients who cannot lift walker repeatedly)
