# E0140 - Walker with Trunk Support / Gait Trainer

## Clinical Overview

The E0140 is a specialized walker with integrated trunk support for patients who cannot maintain upright posture independently. This is typically used for severe neurological or musculoskeletal conditions requiring gait training/retraining.

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:** Medicare requires additional documentation but NO formal prior authorization. NY Medicaid requires **PRIOR APPROVAL** (submit via ePACES or call 800-342-3005) with extensive clinical documentation including comprehensive PT/OT/MD assessment, trial documentation, and home therapy plan.

**Contraindications for NY Medicaid:** CANNOT be prescribed for patients with orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, or osteoporosis.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Meet LCD L33791 standard walker criteria (MRADL impairment, safe use, functional resolution)
- PLUS: Patient unable to maintain upright posture independently requiring trunk support
- Medical record documentation justifying special features beyond standard walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Postural control or stability impairment documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- ADDITIONAL documentation required beyond standard walker criteria
- Must specifically justify trunk support medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document why standard walker inadequate for patient's postural needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- If provided without adequate justification, payment may default to least costly medically appropriate alternative

**Important Notes:**
- NO formal prior authorization required (unlike NY Medicaid)
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- Enhanced documentation burden compared to standard walkers *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Standard DME modifiers apply (NU/RR/UE/KH/KI/KJ)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED** - This is not a standard DVS authorization; this requires formal Prior Approval.

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Home walker with trunk support for adults requiring gait training/retraining
- Severe motor and balance dysfunction documented
- Neuromuscular/congenital disorders OR acquired skeletal abnormalities
- Must demonstrate improved mobility with trial
- Home therapy plan required
- CANNOT have: orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, or osteoporosis

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **Submit via ePACES or call 800-342-3005**
- Detailed Letter of Medical Necessity required including:
  - Comprehensive PT/OT/MD assessment
  - Functional and physical evaluation
  - Documentation of failed alternatives (make/model, trial length) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Home therapy plan with specific goals and timeline *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Home accommodation confirmation (space for device, caregiver availability) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Caregiver training documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Trial documentation showing improved mobility *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency F3: Once every 3 years

**Contraindications (CANNOT prescribe if present):**
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Postural tachycardia syndrome
- Osteogenesis imperfecta
- Osteoporosis

**Important Notes:**
- Prior Approval process more stringent than standard DVS authorization
- Comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Trial period mandatory to demonstrate benefit *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Home environment must accommodate device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same Prior Approval requirements, documentation needs, and contraindications apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - neuromuscular/congenital disorder or acquired skeletal abnormality
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting severe motor and balance dysfunction
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document MRADL impairment (baseline walker criteria)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Specific documentation justifying trunk support beyond standard walker
- [ ] Explain inability to maintain upright posture independently *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Document why standard walker inadequate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid (Prior Approval Required):**
- [ ] **Submit Prior Approval via ePACES or call 800-342-3005**
- [ ] Comprehensive PT/OT assessment with functional evaluation
- [ ] MD assessment documenting diagnosis and medical necessity
- [ ] Physical evaluation including posture, balance, strength, gait *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Documentation of failed alternatives with details (make/model, trial length, why inadequate) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Trial documentation showing improved mobility with trunk support walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Home therapy plan with specific goals, interventions, timeline *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Home accommodation assessment (space, caregiver availability, safety) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Caregiver training documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] **Screen for contraindications:** orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, osteogenesis imperfecta, osteoporosis

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Trunk support feature not justified beyond standard walker capabilities. Fix: Provide detailed documentation of postural control deficits, trial with standard walker showing inadequacy, specific explanation of how trunk support improves function. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Standard walker would be sufficient"** (Medicare) - Documentation doesn't adequately explain why trunk support needed. Fix: Document postural instability, inability to maintain upright position with standard walker, demonstration of improved safety/function with trunk support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Prior Approval not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Equipment dispensed without Prior Approval. Fix: ALWAYS submit Prior Approval via ePACES before dispensing. Cannot be billed without approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Contraindication present"** (Medicaid) - Patient has orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, osteogenesis imperfecta, or osteoporosis. Fix: Screen for contraindications before prescribing. If present, trunk support walker not appropriate per NY Medicaid policy. *(Under Review)*

5. **"Inadequate trial documentation"** (Medicaid) - Trial not documented or didn't demonstrate improvement. Fix: Conduct formal trial, document baseline mobility, mobility with trunk support walker, specific improvements observed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No home therapy plan"** (Medicaid) - Required home therapy plan not provided. Fix: Include detailed therapy plan with goals, specific interventions, frequency, duration, expected outcomes. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus documentation on postural control deficits - be very specific *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain why standard walker cannot provide necessary support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document trial with standard walker if possible, showing inadequacy *(Under Review)*
- Include PT/OT evaluation supporting need for trunk support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Be prepared for potential payment default to least costly alternative if documentation insufficient *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Start Prior Approval process early** - this takes time and requires extensive documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Call 800-342-3005 for guidance on Prior Approval process if needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Ensure comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment (PT, OT, MD) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Conduct and document formal trial** showing improved mobility - this is mandatory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Screen for contraindications BEFORE starting approval process *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Develop detailed home therapy plan with measurable goals *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Assess and document home environment suitability (space, caregiver, safety) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document caregiver training and competency *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include failed alternatives with specific details (what was tried, for how long, why it failed) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
