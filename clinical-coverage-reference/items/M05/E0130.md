# E0130 - Standard Rigid Pickup Walker

## Clinical Overview

The E0130 is the most basic walker type - a rigid frame without wheels that the patient must lift to advance. This is appropriate for patients with adequate upper body strength who need maximum stability during ambulation. Medicare and NY Medicaid both require documentation that mobility limitation significantly impairs MRADLs (Mobility-Related Activities of Daily Living) in the home *(Under Review - High Confidence)* and that the patient can safely use the walker.

**CRITICAL:** This is the least costly medically appropriate alternative for walker upgrades. If a more advanced walker (wheeled, heavy duty, etc.) is provided without proper justification, payment may default to E0130 reimbursement rate.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- Safe use capability - patient must demonstrate ability to lift and use walker safely
- Sufficient functional resolution - walker must improve patient's mobility
- Upper body strength adequate to repeatedly lift walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient cannot resolve mobility limitation with cane *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- Must document MRADL impairment with specific examples *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- Prescription now supports medical necessity per Article A55426 (9/26/2024, retroactive to 1/1/2024)
- Document upper extremity strength assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- This is the baseline walker for cost comparison - if patient receives upgraded walker without justification, payment defaults to E0130 rate
- Standard DME modifiers apply (NU/RR/UE/KH/KI/KJ)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
- Inability to resolve mobility limitation with cane
- Sufficient upper extremity function to lift walker repeatedly
- Safe operation capability demonstrated *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code) - valid for 180 days
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- Must document MRADL impairment and cane inadequacy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity strength assessment required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Length of Need determination required for rental vs. purchase decision

**Rental vs. Purchase Rules:**
- If Length of Need <10 months: Must rent (10% purchase price/month, max 10 months)
- If Length of Need ≥10 months: May rent or purchase at supplier/patient preference
- Frequency F2: Twice per lifetime only

**Important Notes:**
- More restrictive frequency than wheeled walkers (F2 vs. F4)
- Patient must demonstrate adequate upper body strength to lift walker
- DVS authorization expires after 180 days - must be used within that window

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same rental/purchase rules and DVS authorization requirements apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) indicating mobility limitation
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Specific examples of how mobility limitation affects home activities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Documentation that cane insufficient for patient's mobility needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Upper extremity strength assessment (adequate to lift walker) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document safe use capability
- [ ] Prescription supports medical necessity (per A55426 update)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Length of Need estimate (for rental vs. purchase determination)
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient's mobility limitation not severe enough or not documented to impair MRADLs. Fix: Provide specific examples of how patient cannot safely perform toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, or bathing without walker support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Cane would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't explain why walker needed vs. cane. Fix: Document trial with cane showing inadequate support, or explain severity of balance/weakness requiring bilateral support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Patient cannot safely use"** - Concerns about patient's ability to lift walker or cognitive ability to use safely. Fix: Document demonstration of safe walker use, upper body strength assessment, cognitive evaluation if applicable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Upgraded walker paid at E0130 rate"** - Patient received wheeled or specialized walker without justification. Fix: If prescribing upgraded walker, document specific medical reason why E0130 inadequate. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Be very specific about MRADL impairment - use exact examples (e.g., "cannot safely walk to bathroom without risk of fall") *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document safe use capability clearly - note patient demonstration if possible *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If patient needs wheeled walker instead, explain why pick-up style inadequate (reduced endurance, difficulty lifting, etc.) *(Under Review)*
- Reference LCD L33791 criteria explicitly in documentation *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Document upper extremity strength assessment showing adequate lifting capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide Length of Need estimate based on diagnosis and prognosis *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If temporary need, consider rental to avoid frequency limit issues *(Under Review)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Remember F2 frequency (twice per lifetime) is very restrictive - ensure patient truly needs walker before authorizing *(Under Review)*
