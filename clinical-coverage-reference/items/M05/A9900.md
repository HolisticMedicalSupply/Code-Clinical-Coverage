# A9900 - Miscellaneous Walker Supply/Accessory

## Clinical Overview

The A9900 is a catch-all HCPCS code for walker-related supplies, accessories, or service components that do not have a specific HCPCS code. This should **ONLY be used as a last resort** when no other specific code is available, and the item/service is medically necessary as a component of a covered walker (E0130-E0159).

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT:** A9900 is NOT for enhancement accessories like style preferences, color choices, or baskets. Medicare does not cover convenience or comfort items. A9900 is only for medically necessary components without another specific code.

**Billing:** Requires detailed description of item/service and justification. NY Medicaid priced **By Report (BR)** at cost+51%.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Specific HCPCS code should be used"** - Most common denial. Item has specific code but A9900 was billed. Fix: Research HCPCS codes thoroughly before using A9900. Check if E0154 (platform), E0155 (wheels), E0156 (seat), E0157 (crutch holder), E0158 (leg extensions), E0159 (brake) apply. A9900 is last resort only. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Not medically necessary"** - Item described as convenience, comfort, or style preference. Fix: Document medical necessity clearly. Explain how item improves function or safety, not just convenience. Enhancement accessories (baskets, colors, style) not covered. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Insufficient description"** - Vague or incomplete description of item. Fix: Provide detailed description including: item name, manufacturer, model number, specifications, function, how it attaches to walker, clinical benefit. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No justification for miscellaneous code"** - Didn't explain why specific code cannot be used. Fix: Explicitly state "No specific HCPCS code available for this item" and explain why standard codes don't fit. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Enhancement accessory not covered"** (Medicare) - Item is style, color, or convenience feature. Fix: Medicare doesn't cover enhancement accessories. Item must be medically necessary component, not aesthetic or convenience upgrade. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No acquisition cost documentation"** (Medicaid) - Cost not documented for By Report pricing. Fix: Submit detailed line-item invoice with acquisition cost. Include manufacturer invoice or cost documentation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **Use A9900 as absolute last resort** - exhaust all specific codes first *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
