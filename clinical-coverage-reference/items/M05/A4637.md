# A4637 - Walker Replacement Tip (Each)

## Clinical Overview

The A4637 is a replacement tip for walkers (E0130-E0158), billed per tip. This is a safety-critical replacement supply for patient-owned walkers when existing tips are worn or damaged, essential for walker stability and safe ambulation.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL MEDICAID DIFFERENCE:** A4637 for **WALKERS requires DVS authorization** in NY Medicaid - this is **different from canes/crutches** which are direct bill. This same HCPCS code has different authorization requirements depending on the base equipment type.

**Billing:** A4637 is billed **"each"** - typically order 4 tips for standard walker (all four legs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

- No separate diagnosis required beyond base walker coverage per LCD L33791

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Document tip wear or damage *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Reference original walker prescription/date *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Subject to reasonable replacement based on wear

- Subject to reasonable replacement intervals *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Typically order 4 tips for complete walker replacement *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Replacement tips for patient-owned walkers
- Safety-critical replacement when existing tip worn/damaged for stability
- No specific diagnosis beyond original walker qualification

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)** - **CRITICAL: Different from canes/crutches (direct bill)**
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- **Original walker fiscal order must be on file**
- **Walker must be <5 years old**
- Document tip wear/damage necessitating replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Up to 5 tips per year allowed
- Fee: ~$1.87-$1.90 each

**Important Notes:**
- DVS requirement for WALKER tips specifically
- Same HCPCS code (A4637) has different authorization for canes/crutches (see M01 category - direct bill)
- Walker age restriction (<5 years) applies
- Typically 4 tips per walker (all four legs), but up to 5 per year allowed total
- DVS authorization valid 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same DVS requirement for walker tips and walker age restrictions apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - mobility condition (same as base walker)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting tip replacement need
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Reference to original walker (type, date provided)**
- [ ] Documentation of tip wear or damage *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Walker age documentation (must be <5 years for Medicaid) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Quantity needed (typically 4 for all four legs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document base walker coverage (E0130-E0158)
- [ ] Explain tip replacement need (wear, damage) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY (required for walker tips)**
- [ ] Original walker fiscal order must be on file
- [ ] Document walker age (<5 years)
- [ ] Explain tip wear/damage and safety need *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Specify quantity (up to 5 per year allowed)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No DVS authorization"** (Medicaid) - Most common error for walker tips. A4637 for walkers billed without DVS authorization. Fix: **WALKERS require DVS authorization** (# code). Same HCPCS code has different requirements: walkers need DVS, canes/crutches are direct bill. Submit DVS authorization before dispensing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No documentation of original walker"** - Cannot verify patient owns walker needing tips. Fix: Reference original walker prescription/order with date. Provide walker type (E0130-E0158) and date initially provided. For Medicaid, original fiscal order must be on file. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Walker >5 years old"** (Medicaid) - Walker exceeds 5-year age limit. Fix: Document current walker age. If walker >5 years old, patient may need new walker rather than replacement tips. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Exceeds frequency limit"** (Medicaid) - Requesting more than 5 tips per year. Fix: Medicaid allows up to 5 tips per year. Standard walker has 4 tips, but annual limit is 5 total. Space tip replacements appropriately. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Not medically necessary"** - Tip replacement not justified. Fix: Document specific tip wear (rubber worn down, cracked, safety concern). Explain safety requirement for walker stability. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document tip wear or damage clearly (e.g., "worn rubber compromising stability," "cracked tip creating safety hazard") *(Under Review)*
- Reference original walker prescription with date provided *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Typically order 4 tips for complete set (all four walker legs) *(Under Review)*
- Subject to reasonable replacement - document wear pattern if replacing frequently *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **CRITICAL: Submit DVS authorization** - walker tips require DVS, different from canes/crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify original walker fiscal order on file** before ordering tips *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document walker age - must be <5 years old *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Up to 5 tips per year allowed - plan replacement accordingly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Typically order 4 tips for complete walker replacement (all four legs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If walker approaching 5 years old, consider ordering new walker instead of just tips *(Under Review)*

**Key Difference - Walker vs. Cane/Crutch:**
- **WALKERS (M05):** A4637 requires DVS authorization in NY Medicaid
- **CANES/CRUTCHES (M01):** A4637 is direct bill (NO DVS) in NY Medicaid
- Same HCPCS code, different authorization requirements based on base equipment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Related Codes

- **E0130-E0158** - Walker base equipment requiring A4637 tips
- **E0159** - Replacement brake for wheeled walker (other replacement accessory)
- **A4636** - Replacement handgrip (other walker accessory)
- **A4635** - Underarm pad for crutches (replacement accessory)

**Note:** A4637 also exists in M01 category for canes/crutches with different Medicaid authorization (direct bill vs. DVS required).
