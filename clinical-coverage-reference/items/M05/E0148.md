# E0148 - Heavy Duty Pickup Walker (No Wheels)

## Clinical Overview

The E0148 is a heavy duty pickup walker (no wheels) designed to support beneficiaries weighing **MORE than 300 pounds**. This walker requires lifting to advance, so the patient must have adequate upper body strength despite the higher weight capacity.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WEIGHT REQUIREMENT:** Patient weight **>300 lbs** must be documented. If E0148 is provided and beneficiary weighs â‰¤300 lbs, Medicare will DENY as not reasonable and necessary. NY Medicaid will default payment to E0130 or E0135 (standard pickup walker) rate, creating financial loss.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Meet LCD L33791 standard walker criteria (MRADL impairment, safe use, functional resolution)
- **PLUS: Beneficiary weighs MORE than 300 pounds documented**
- Upper body strength adequate to repeatedly lift heavy duty walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient cannot resolve mobility limitation with cane *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- **Weight documentation REQUIRED** - must document beneficiary weight >300 lbs
- Current weight from recent physical exam or clinical visit *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must document MRADL impairment with specific examples *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- **If provided and beneficiary weighs â‰¤300 lbs, will be DENIED**

**Important Notes:**
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- Weight threshold is strict - â‰¤300 lbs results in denial
- Standard DME modifiers apply (NU/RR/UE/KH/KI/KJ)
- Upper body strength must be adequate to lift heavier walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Heavy duty pickup walker for members >300 pounds
- Weight capacity greater than standard walkers
- Meets basic walker coverage criteria (MRADL impairment, safe use, etc.)
- **PLUS: Documented weight >300 lbs**
- Sufficient upper extremity function to lift heavy duty walker repeatedly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- **Must document current member weight from recent physical exam**
- Height/weight documentation required
- Must document MRADL impairment and cane inadequacy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity strength assessment required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency F3: Once every 3 years

**Payment Default Risk:**
- **If member weighs â‰¤300 lbs, payment defaults to E0130 or E0135 rate**
- This creates significant financial loss - heavy duty cost significantly higher than standard
- Weight documentation from recent clinical visit essential *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Weight threshold strictly enforced
- Consider E0149 (wheeled heavy duty) for patients who cannot lift walker *(Under Review)*
- DVS authorization valid 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same weight documentation requirements and payment default risk apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - **MUST include obesity code (E66.x) or document weight >300 lbs**
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Current documented weight from recent physical exam showing >300 lbs**
- [ ] Date of weight measurement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Upper extremity strength assessment (adequate to lift heavy duty walker) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document MRADL impairment (baseline walker criteria)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Weight documentation showing >300 lbs - failure to document results in denial**
- [ ] Explain why standard weight capacity walker inadequate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Current weight from recent physical exam (within last 30-90 days recommended)** *(Under Review)*
- [ ] Height/weight documentation
- [ ] Upper extremity strength assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Weight not documented" or "Weight â‰¤300 lbs"** - Most common denial. Patient weight not documented or documented as â‰¤300 lbs. Fix: Include current documented weight from recent physical exam showing >300 lbs. Use obesity ICD-10 code (E66.x). Document date of weight measurement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Standard walker would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't establish need for heavy duty weight capacity. Fix: Explicitly state patient weight >300 lbs exceeds standard walker capacity (typically 250-300 lbs). Document weight on formal scale. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient's mobility limitation not severe enough or not documented to impair MRADLs. Fix: Provide specific examples of MRADL impairment (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing). Weight alone doesn't establish medical necessity for walker - must also show MRADL impairment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Payment defaulted to E0130/E0135"** (Medicaid) - Weight not adequately documented or â‰¤300 lbs. Fix: Obtain recent weight documentation from physician visit, document current weight >300 lbs, explain standard walker weight capacity inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Patient cannot safely lift walker"** - Concerns about upper body strength with heavy duty walker. Fix: Document upper extremity strength assessment, demonstration of lifting capability, consider E0149 (wheeled) if lifting problematic. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Weight documentation is non-negotiable** - must show >300 lbs from recent clinical measurement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include date of weight measurement for credibility *(Under Review)*
- Use obesity diagnosis code (E66.x) in addition to mobility codes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document on formal calibrated scale, not self-reported weight *(Under Review)*
- Explain standard walker weight capacity (typically 250-300 lbs) inadequate *(Under Review)*
- If patient at/near 300 lbs threshold, document clearly >300 to avoid denial *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Obtain weight documentation from recent physician visit** (within last 30-90 days recommended) *(Under Review)*
- Include height/weight documentation from physical exam *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document current weight to avoid payment default risk *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If patient's weight fluctuates, use most recent documented weight >300 lbs *(Under Review)*
- Consider E0149 (wheeled heavy duty) if patient has difficulty lifting due to reduced endurance *(Under Review)*
- Remember payment may default to E0130/E0135 - ensure weight documentation thorough before dispensing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Related Codes

- **E0130** - Rigid pickup walker (standard weight capacity, <300 lbs)
- **E0135** - Folding pickup walker (standard weight capacity, payment default if E0148 criteria not met)
- **E0149** - Heavy duty wheeled walker (for patients >300 lbs who cannot lift walker)
- **E0147** - Heavy duty walker with multiple braking (requires neurologic/hand restriction in addition to weight)
- **A4637** - Replacement tips for walker (DVS required)
