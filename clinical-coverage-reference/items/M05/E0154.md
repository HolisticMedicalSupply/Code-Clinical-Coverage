# E0154 - Walker Platform Attachment (Forearm Support)

## Clinical Overview

The E0154 is a platform attachment for walkers that provides a forearm support surface, allowing patients to bear weight through their forearms rather than hands/wrists. This accessory is appropriate for patients with hand, wrist, or elbow conditions that prevent standard handgrip use, such as arthritis, fractures, nerve injuries, or neurological conditions affecting grip strength.

**Billing:** E0154 is billed **"each"** - one platform for unilateral need, two platforms for bilateral need. Can be billed at initial walker issue or as replacement for existing walker.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Base walker meets LCD L33791 criteria (MRADL impairment, safe use, functional resolution)
- Patient cannot bear weight through hands/wrists due to upper extremity condition
- Appropriate conditions: arthritis, fractures, nerve injuries affecting hand/wrist/elbow function
- Platform attachment medically necessary for walker use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Standard handgrips insufficient for patient's upper extremity needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Must document why standard handgrips insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document upper extremity condition (arthritis, fracture, pain, weakness, etc.)
- Explain need for forearm weight-bearing platform vs. hand grip *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Can be used for initial issue with new walker or replacement for existing walker
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- May be billed separately from base walker with AV modifier *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Subject to reasonable replacement intervals *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must be medically necessary, not for comfort/convenience *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Billed "each" - quantity based on unilateral (1) or bilateral (2) need *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Platform attachment supporting arm for members unable to bear weight through wrist/hand
- Upper extremity weakness/pain preventing hand grip
- Wrist/hand arthritis or injury requiring forearm support vs. hand grip
- Base walker meets standard MRADL criteria

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- Must document diagnosis requiring forearm support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity assessment showing need for platform vs. standard grip *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Can be billed at initial walker issue OR as replacement
- Frequency F7: Twice per year (every 6 months)

**Important Notes:**
- Must be medically necessary (not comfort/convenience)
- Billed "each" - 1 for unilateral, 2 for bilateral need *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Can be added to existing walker or ordered with new walker
- DVS authorization valid 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same DVS authorization requirements and documentation needs apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - **MUST include upper extremity condition (arthritis, pain, fracture, nerve injury, etc.)**
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting inability to use standard handgrips
- [ ] Upper extremity assessment showing hand/wrist/elbow condition *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explanation of why forearm support needed vs. standard grip *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Specify unilateral (1 platform) or bilateral (2 platforms) need *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document base walker meets MRADL criteria (if ordering with new walker)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Document specific upper extremity condition preventing standard handgrip use
- [ ] Explain medical necessity for platform attachment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] Upper extremity functional assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Document diagnosis and how platform enables walker use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Specify quantity needed (1 or 2) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Platform described as comfort/convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: Document specific upper extremity condition (arthritis, fracture, pain, weakness) preventing handgrip use. Explain patient cannot use walker safely with standard grips due to medical condition. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Handgrips would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't establish why forearm support needed. Fix: Document trial with standard grips showing pain, weakness, or inability to bear weight through hands. Explain specific medical reason standard grip inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Base walker not covered"** - Platform accessory denied because base walker doesn't meet criteria. Fix: Ensure base walker meets MRADL criteria first. Platform can only be covered as accessory to covered walker. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Insufficient documentation of upper extremity condition"** - Diagnosis mentioned but not adequately explained. Fix: Include detailed upper extremity assessment, strength testing, pain assessment, functional limitations with standard grips. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Comfort/convenience item"** - Perceived as non-medical enhancement. Fix: Clearly document medical necessity - patient cannot safely use walker without platform due to specific medical condition. Not for convenience. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus documentation on medical necessity, not comfort *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific upper extremity pathology (arthritis severity, fracture details, nerve injury, etc.) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include upper extremity function assessment showing grip limitation *(Under Review)*
- If possible, document trial with standard grips showing inadequacy *(Under Review)*
- Explain how platform enables safe walker use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- PT/OT evaluation supporting need for platform helpful *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Obtain comprehensive upper extremity assessment from PT/OT or physician *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document diagnosis and functional impact clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify unilateral vs. bilateral need based on clinical assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F7 frequency allows replacement twice per year if needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Can be added to existing walker or ordered with new walker - document accordingly *(Under Review)*
