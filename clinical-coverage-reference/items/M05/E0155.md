# E0155 - Walker Wheel Attachment (Per Pair)

## Clinical Overview

The E0155 is a wheel attachment to convert a rigid pickup walker (E0130) to wheeled configuration. This accessory is used when a patient's mobility status changes and they are no longer able to lift the walker effectively, or when replacing worn wheels on an existing walker. The wheels allow continuous ambulation without repeated lifting.

**Billing:** E0155 is billed **"per pair"** - typically one pair of wheels for front of walker.

**Common Scenarios:** Patient initially required pickup walker but now has reduced endurance, cardiopulmonary condition worsening, or general deconditioning affecting ability to lift walker repeatedly.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Base walker (E0130) meets LCD L33791 criteria
- Change in patient status justifying need for wheels
- Patient no longer able to lift walker effectively due to reduced endurance, strength decline, or cardiopulmonary condition *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Wheels medically necessary for continued walker use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Requires covered base pickup walker (E0130)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Must document change in patient status justifying need for wheels *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain why patient can no longer lift walker effectively *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document reduced endurance, strength decline, or medical condition affecting lifting ability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Original walker (E0130) must be documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required

**Important Notes:**
- Subject to reasonable replacement for worn wheels *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Used for replacements on existing walker or when converting pickup to wheeled
- Requires covered base walker - cannot add wheels to non-covered walker
- Billed per pair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Adds wheels to rigid pick-up walker
- Converts E0130/E0135 to wheeled configuration per pair billing
- Original pick-up walker on file
- Change in member's condition requiring wheels
- Member no longer able to lift walker effectively

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- Must document change in condition and decreased ability to lift walker
- Original walker fiscal order must be on file *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Can be billed for new walker or replacement for patient-owned walker
- Frequency F7: Twice per year per pair

**Important Notes:**
- Can convert E0130 or E0135 to wheeled configuration
- Requires documentation of original pickup walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Change in condition must be documented (reduced endurance, strength decline, etc.) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- DVS authorization valid 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same DVS authorization requirements and documentation needs apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - should include condition affecting lifting ability (weakness, fatigue, cardiopulmonary condition, etc.)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting change in patient status
- [ ] Explanation of why patient can no longer lift walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Documentation of reduced endurance, strength, or medical condition *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Reference to original pickup walker (E0130 or E0135) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document base walker (E0130) meets MRADL criteria
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Document change in patient status - what has changed since pickup walker was provided
- [ ] Explain decreased ability to lift walker (reduced endurance, cardiopulmonary decline, etc.) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] Original walker fiscal order on file *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Document change in member's condition *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explain why member can no longer lift walker effectively *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No documented change in status"** - Wheels requested but no explanation why patient can no longer lift walker. Fix: Document specific change (e.g., "Patient developed CHF with reduced endurance, can no longer lift walker 20+ times daily," or "Generalized deconditioning post-hospitalization, reduced upper body strength"). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Base walker not covered"** - Wheels denied because original E0130 doesn't meet criteria or not documented. Fix: Ensure E0130 meets MRADL criteria and is documented. Reference original walker prescription/order. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Not medically necessary"** - Wheels described as convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: Document medical reason patient cannot continue lifting walker (cardiopulmonary condition, muscle weakness, post-surgical fatigue, etc.). Explain medical necessity, not convenience. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Original walker not documented"** (Medicaid) - Cannot verify patient has pickup walker needing wheels. Fix: Reference original E0130 or E0135 fiscal order. Include date of original walker provision. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Should order new wheeled walker"** - Suggestion patient should get E0141 or E0143 instead of converting E0130. Fix: Explain cost-effectiveness of adding wheels to existing walker vs. new walker, or document patient preference to keep existing walker. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on change in medical status - what's different now vs. when pickup walker provided *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific medical reason for reduced lifting ability (CHF, COPD, post-surgical fatigue, generalized weakness, etc.) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain frequency of walker use and burden of repeated lifting *(Under Review)*
- If patient recently hospitalized or had medical event, document how this affected lifting ability *(Under Review)*
- Reference original E0130 prescription/date *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- Document change in condition clearly - before and after comparison helpful *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Reference original pickup walker fiscal order with date *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F7 frequency allows replacement twice per year if wheels wear out *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Can be used for new walker conversion or replacement on existing walker - document which scenario applies *(Under Review)*
- Consider ordering new E0141 or E0143 if patient needs completely new walker - may be more appropriate than converting old E0130 *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0130** - Rigid pickup walker (base equipment for wheel attachment)
- **E0135** - Folding pickup walker (also can use wheel attachment)
- **E0141** - Rigid wheeled walker (alternative to converting E0130 - new walker with wheels built-in)
- **E0143** - Folding wheeled walker (alternative to converting - most common wheeled walker)
- **E0159** - Replacement brake for wheeled walker (may be needed if converting to wheeled configuration)
