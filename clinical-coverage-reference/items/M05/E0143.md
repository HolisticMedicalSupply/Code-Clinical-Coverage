# E0143 - Folding Wheeled Walker (Standard 2-Wheel Walker)

## Clinical Overview

The E0143 is the **most common walker type** - a folding wheeled walker with typically 2 front wheels and 2 rear glides for continuous ambulation. This combines the benefits of wheeled mobility (more natural gait, continuous ambulation) with folding convenience for transport and storage. It is appropriate for patients with adequate balance but reduced endurance who cannot repeatedly lift a pickup walker.

**KEY ADVANTAGE (NY Medicaid):** E0143 has **Frequency F4 (four per year/once every 3 months)** - significantly more replacements allowed than pickup walkers (F2 = twice per lifetime) or rigid wheeled walker (F2).

**IMPORTANT:** E0143 is considered the least costly medically appropriate alternative for wheeled walkers. Brakes are included in the base price at initial issue for NY Medicaid - replacement brake (E0159) cannot be billed separately at initial walker issue.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- Safe use capability - patient must demonstrate ability to safely propel wheeled walker
- Sufficient functional resolution - walker must improve patient's mobility
- Adequate balance and coordination for wheeled device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient cannot resolve mobility limitation with cane *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity strength adequate for braking and control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- Must document MRADL impairment with specific examples *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document balance and coordination adequate for wheeled walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- Prescription now supports medical necessity per Article A55426 (9/26/2024, retroactive to 1/1/2024)

**Important Notes:**
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- Most common walker type prescribed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If upgraded walker provided without adequate justification, payment may default to E0143 rate
- Standard DME modifiers apply (NU/RR/UE/KH/KI/KJ)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
- Inability to resolve mobility limitation with cane
- Adequate upper extremity strength for wheeled walker control
- Sufficient balance and coordination for wheeled device
- Same safe propulsion and balance/coordination requirements as E0141

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code) - valid for 180 days
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- Must document MRADL impairment and cane inadequacy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Balance and coordination assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Length of Need determination for rental vs. purchase decision

**Rental vs. Purchase Rules:**
- Rental: 10% purchase price/month (max 10 months)
- Length of Need determines rental vs. purchase eligibility
- **Frequency F4: Four per year (once every 3 months)** - HIGHER than pickup walkers

**Important Notes:**
- **FREQUENCY ADVANTAGE:** F4 allows more replacements than F2 pickup walkers or E0141 rigid wheeled
- Brakes included in base price at initial issue - E0159 CANNOT be billed separately at initial issue
- E0159 (replacement brake) only billable for replacement on patient-owned walker
- Considered least costly medically appropriate alternative for wheeled walkers
- DVS authorization expires after 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same rental/purchase rules, DVS authorization requirements, frequency advantage, and brake billing restrictions apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) indicating mobility limitation
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Specific examples of how mobility limitation affects home activities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Documentation that cane insufficient for patient's mobility needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Balance and coordination assessment (adequate for wheeled device) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Upper extremity strength assessment (adequate for braking/control) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document safe use capability with wheeled walker
- [ ] Explain why wheeled walker needed (e.g., cannot lift pickup walker due to reduced endurance) *(Under Review)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Length of Need estimate (for rental vs. purchase determination)
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] Document balance/coordination adequate for wheeled configuration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient's mobility limitation not severe enough or not documented to impair MRADLs. Fix: Provide specific examples of how patient cannot safely perform toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, or bathing without walker support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Pickup walker would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't explain why wheeled walker needed vs. pickup style. Fix: Document reduced endurance preventing repeated lifting, trial with pickup walker showing inadequacy due to fatigue, or explain continuous ambulation needs. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Patient lacks balance for wheeled walker"** - Concerns about patient's balance/coordination with wheels. Fix: Document balance assessment showing adequate control, demonstration of safe wheeled walker use, cognitive evaluation if applicable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Upgraded walker paid at E0143 rate"** - Patient received specialized walker (heavy duty, enclosed, etc.) without justification. Fix: E0143 is the baseline for wheeled walkers - if prescribing upgraded model, document specific medical reason why E0143 inadequate. *(Under Review)*

5. **"Brake billed at initial issue"** (Medicaid) - E0159 incorrectly billed with new walker. Fix: E0159 CANNOT be billed at initial walker issue - brakes included in E0143 base price. E0159 only for replacement on patient-owned walker. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on MRADL impairment and safe use capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document why continuous ambulation important (e.g., endurance issues, fatigue with repeated lifting of pickup walker) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document balance and coordination adequate for wheeled configuration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- E0143 is the most common walker - typically straightforward approval if MRADL criteria met *(Under Review)*
- Reference LCD L33791 criteria explicitly in documentation *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Document balance and coordination assessment clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide Length of Need estimate based on diagnosis and prognosis *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Take advantage of F4 frequency** - allows replacement up to 4 times per year if needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **DO NOT bill E0159 at initial walker issue** - brakes included in base price *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- E0143 is considered baseline/least costly for wheeled walkers - straightforward approval *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0130** - Rigid pickup walker (no wheels, requires lifting)
- **E0141** - Rigid wheeled walker (non-folding, F2 frequency vs. E0143 F4)
- **E0144** - Enclosed walker (requires strong justification, may default to E0143 payment)
- **E0149** - Heavy duty wheeled walker (for patients >300 lbs)
- **E0159** - Replacement brake (REPLACEMENT ONLY - cannot bill at initial issue)
- **A4637** - Replacement tips for walker (DVS required)
- **E0156** - Seat attachment (if patient needs rest periods during ambulation)
