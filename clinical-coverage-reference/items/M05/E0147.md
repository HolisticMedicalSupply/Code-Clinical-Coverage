# E0147 - Heavy Duty Four-Wheeled Walker with Advanced Braking

## Clinical Overview

The E0147 is a four-wheeled heavy duty walker (supports >350 lbs) with advanced multiple braking system and variable wheel resistance. This specialized walker is designed for patients who meet standard walker criteria **PLUS** have severe neurologic disorder OR condition restricting one hand use.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** **OBESITY ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT** to qualify for E0147. Patient must have a neurologic disorder or restricted hand use condition requiring the specialized braking system, in addition to meeting standard walker criteria.

**Payment Default Risk:** If neurologic/hand restriction criteria not met, payment will default to E0143 (folding wheeled) or E0149 (heavy duty wheeled without special braking) - creating significant financial loss.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Meet LCD L33791 standard walker criteria (MRADL impairment, safe use, functional resolution)
- **PLUS ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:**
  - Severe neurologic disorder restricting use of one hand, OR
  - Other condition causing restricted one hand use
- **Weight capacity requirement:** Patient typically >350 lbs (heavy duty designation) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **OBESITY ALONE NOT SUFFICIENT** - must have neurologic/hand restriction justification

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- **ADDITIONAL documentation required** beyond standard walker criteria
- Must document specific neurologic disorder (e.g., hemiplegia, Parkinson's, stroke) OR condition restricting hand use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain why multiple braking system needed due to hand/neurologic limitation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document upper extremity function assessment showing one hand restriction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- **If criteria not met, payment defaults to E0143 or E0149**

**Important Notes:**
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- This is NOT just a heavy duty walker - specialized braking is key feature
- Standard DME modifiers apply (NU/RR/UE/KH/KI/KJ)
- Higher cost than standard walkers - documentation critical to avoid payment default

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Heavy duty walker with special braking system and variable wheel resistance
- Severe neurologic condition affecting hand use, OR
- Specific qualifying: severe neurologic disorder restricting use of one hand OR other conditions causing restricted one hand use
- **OBESITY ALONE NOT SUFFICIENT REASON**
- Must meet standard walker MRADL criteria PLUS restricted hand use criteria

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- **Must document specific hand/upper extremity limitation**
- Documentation of neurologic diagnosis OR hand function condition affecting bilateral upper extremity assessment required
- Explain need for multiple braking system and variable resistance due to hand limitation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity function evaluation documenting one hand restriction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency F3: Once every 3 years

**Payment Default Risk:**
- If criteria not met (i.e., only obesity documented without neurologic/hand restriction), payment defaults to E0143 or E0149
- **This creates significant financial loss** - E0147 cost significantly higher than standard wheeled walkers
- Comprehensive documentation essential before dispensing

**Important Notes:**
- Focus documentation on neurologic or hand function impairment, NOT just weight
- PT/OT evaluation of upper extremity function strongly recommended *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Neurologist documentation helpful for neurologic conditions *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same DVS authorization requirements, hand restriction documentation needs, and payment default risk apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - **MUST include neurologic disorder OR hand/upper extremity condition**
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting standard MRADL impairment
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Documentation of severe neurologic disorder OR restricted one hand use condition
- [ ] Upper extremity function assessment showing one hand restriction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explanation of why multiple braking system needed due to neurologic/hand limitation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Patient weight documentation (typically >350 lbs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document baseline MRADL impairment (standard walker criteria)
- [ ] **ADDITIONAL:** Specific documentation of neurologic disorder (e.g., hemiplegia, Parkinson's, stroke with residual) OR hand restriction condition
- [ ] Explain why standard wheeled walker (E0143) inadequate due to hand limitation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explain need for specialized braking system *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] Comprehensive upper extremity assessment documenting one hand restriction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Neurologic diagnosis documentation (if applicable)
- [ ] Explanation of how multiple braking and variable resistance benefit patient's specific condition *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Obesity alone not sufficient"** - Documentation only mentions patient weight without neurologic or hand restriction. Fix: Document specific neurologic disorder (hemiplegia, Parkinson's, etc.) OR condition restricting one hand use (stroke with residual weakness, shoulder injury, etc.). Explain why specialized braking needed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Payment defaulted to E0143/E0149"** - Inadequate justification for specialized braking system. Fix: Provide comprehensive documentation of hand/upper extremity limitation, upper extremity function assessment, explanation of why standard braking insufficient due to one hand restriction. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Standard wheeled walker would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't demonstrate need for multiple braking system. Fix: Document specific challenges with standard walker braking due to neurologic/hand condition, explain how multiple braking system and variable resistance improve safety and function. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Insufficient neurologic documentation"** - Neurologic condition mentioned but not adequately documented. Fix: Include neurologist assessment or detailed neurologic exam, document specific hand function deficits, upper extremity strength testing showing one-sided limitation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Focus documentation on neurologic or hand restriction, NOT weight** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include specific neurologic diagnosis (ICD-10) with documentation of hand function impact *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Obtain PT/OT assessment of upper extremity function showing one hand restriction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain why multiple braking system specifically needed (e.g., "Patient has right hemiplegia limiting right hand function, requires left hand control with specialized braking accessible from one side") *(Under Review)*
- Document trial with standard walker showing braking difficulty if possible *(Under Review)*
- Be prepared for potential payment default if documentation insufficient *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Obtain comprehensive upper extremity function evaluation** - document specific hand/arm limitations *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If neurologic condition, include neurologist documentation supporting diagnosis and functional impact *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **DO NOT rely on obesity alone** - always document neurologic or hand restriction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain specific benefit of multiple braking system for patient's one hand limitation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Remember payment may default to E0143 or E0149 - ensure justification thorough before dispensing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Consider discussing financial risk with patient/family if justification marginal *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0143** - Folding wheeled walker (standard alternative, payment default if E0147 not justified)
- **E0149** - Heavy duty wheeled walker (alternative for >300 lbs without specialized braking needs, payment default option)
- **E0148** - Heavy duty pickup walker (for heavy patients who can lift walker)
