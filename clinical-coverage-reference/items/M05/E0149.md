# E0149 - Heavy Duty Wheeled Walker

## Clinical Overview

The E0149 is a heavy duty wheeled walker designed to support beneficiaries weighing **MORE than 300 pounds**. The wheeled configuration allows for continuous ambulation without repeated lifting, appropriate for bariatric patients with adequate balance but reduced endurance or inability to lift heavy duty pickup walker.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WEIGHT REQUIREMENT:** Patient weight **>300 lbs** must be documented. If E0149 is provided and beneficiary weighs â‰¤300 lbs, Medicare will DENY as not reasonable and necessary. NY Medicaid will default payment to E0141 or E0143 (standard wheeled walker) rate.

**IMPORTANT (NY Medicaid):** Brakes included in base price at initial issue - E0159 (replacement brake) CANNOT be billed separately at initial issue.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Meet LCD L33791 standard walker criteria (MRADL impairment, safe use, functional resolution)
- **PLUS: Beneficiary weighs MORE than 300 pounds documented**
- Adequate balance and coordination for wheeled device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity strength adequate for braking and control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient cannot resolve mobility limitation with cane *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- **Weight documentation REQUIRED** - must document beneficiary weight >300 lbs
- Current weight from recent physical exam or clinical visit *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must document MRADL impairment with specific examples *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document balance and coordination adequate for wheeled walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required
- **If provided and beneficiary weighs â‰¤300 lbs, will be DENIED**

**Important Notes:**
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- Weight threshold is strict - â‰¤300 lbs results in denial
- Standard DME modifiers apply (NU/RR/UE/KH/KI/KJ)
- Patient must demonstrate safe use of wheeled walker *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Heavy duty wheeled walker for members >300 pounds
- Wheeled version of heavy duty walker
- Meets basic walker criteria (MRADL impairment, safe use, etc.)
- **PLUS: Documented weight >300 lbs and adequate upper extremity function for wheeled walker**
- Adequate balance and coordination for wheeled device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- **Must document current member weight from recent physical exam**
- Balance and coordination assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity strength assessment for braking/control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency F3: Once every 3 years

**Payment Default Risk:**
- **If member weighs â‰¤300 lbs, payment defaults to E0141 or E0143 rate**
- This creates significant financial loss - heavy duty cost significantly higher than standard
- Weight documentation from recent clinical visit essential *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **Brakes included in base price at initial issue** - E0159 CANNOT be billed separately at initial issue
- E0159 (replacement brake) only billable for replacement on patient-owned walker
- Weight threshold strictly enforced
- DVS authorization valid 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same weight documentation requirements, brake billing restrictions, and payment default risk apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - **MUST include obesity code (E66.x) or document weight >300 lbs**
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Current documented weight from recent physical exam showing >300 lbs**
- [ ] Balance and coordination assessment (adequate for wheeled walker) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Upper extremity strength assessment (adequate for braking/control) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Date of weight measurement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document MRADL impairment (baseline walker criteria)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Weight documentation showing >300 lbs - failure to document results in denial**
- [ ] Document balance/coordination adequate for wheeled configuration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explain why standard weight capacity wheeled walker inadequate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Current weight from recent physical exam (within last 30-90 days recommended)** *(Under Review)*
- [ ] Balance and coordination assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Upper extremity strength assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Weight not documented" or "Weight â‰¤300 lbs"** - Most common denial. Patient weight not documented or documented as â‰¤300 lbs. Fix: Include current documented weight from recent physical exam showing >300 lbs. Use obesity ICD-10 code (E66.x). Document date of weight measurement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Standard wheeled walker would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't establish need for heavy duty weight capacity. Fix: Explicitly state patient weight >300 lbs exceeds standard walker capacity (typically 250-300 lbs). Document weight on formal scale. Explain standard wheeled walker (E0141, E0143) inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Patient lacks balance for wheeled walker"** - Concerns about balance/coordination with wheeled device for bariatric patient. Fix: Document balance assessment showing adequate control, demonstration of safe wheeled walker use, cognitive evaluation if applicable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Payment defaulted to E0141/E0143"** (Medicaid) - Weight not adequately documented or â‰¤300 lbs. Fix: Obtain recent weight documentation from physician visit, document current weight >300 lbs, explain standard walker weight capacity inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Brake billed at initial issue"** (Medicaid) - E0159 incorrectly billed with new walker. Fix: E0159 CANNOT be billed at initial walker issue - brakes included in E0149 base price. E0159 only for replacement on patient-owned walker. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient's mobility limitation not severe enough. Fix: Provide specific examples of MRADL impairment. Weight alone doesn't establish medical necessity - must also show MRADL impairment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Weight documentation is non-negotiable** - must show >300 lbs from recent clinical measurement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include date of weight measurement for credibility *(Under Review)*
- Use obesity diagnosis code (E66.x) in addition to mobility codes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document on formal calibrated scale, not self-reported weight *(Under Review)*
- Document balance and coordination adequate for wheeled configuration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain standard wheeled walker weight capacity (typically 250-300 lbs) inadequate *(Under Review)*
- If patient at/near 300 lbs threshold, document clearly >300 to avoid denial *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Obtain weight documentation from recent physician visit** (within last 30-90 days recommended) *(Under Review)*
- Document balance and coordination assessment clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Upper extremity strength assessment for braking/control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **DO NOT bill E0159 at initial walker issue** - brakes included in base price *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document current weight to avoid payment default risk *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If patient's weight fluctuates, use most recent documented weight >300 lbs *(Under Review)*
- Consider E0148 (pickup heavy duty) if patient can lift walker but wheeled not needed *(Under Review)*
- Remember payment may default to E0141/E0143 - ensure weight documentation thorough before dispensing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Related Codes

- **E0141** - Rigid wheeled walker (standard weight capacity, payment default if E0149 criteria not met)
- **E0143** - Folding wheeled walker (standard weight capacity, most common)
- **E0148** - Heavy duty pickup walker (for patients >300 lbs who can lift walker)
- **E0147** - Heavy duty walker with multiple braking (requires neurologic/hand restriction in addition to weight)
- **E0159** - Replacement brake (REPLACEMENT ONLY - cannot bill at initial issue, only for patient-owned walker)
- **A4637** - Replacement tips for walker (DVS required)
