# E0158 - Walker Leg Extensions (Set of 4)

## Clinical Overview

The E0158 is a set of leg extensions to increase walker height for tall patients. These extensions are added to all four legs of the walker to achieve proper ergonomics and prevent back/neck strain from bending to a walker that is too low.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL HEIGHT RESTRICTION:** Covered **ONLY for beneficiaries 6 feet tall or more (â‰¥72 inches)**. If E0158 is provided for beneficiary <6 feet tall, Medicare will DENY and Medicaid will not cover. Height documentation is mandatory.

**Billing:** E0158 is billed **"per set of four"** - includes extensions for all four walker legs.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Base walker meets LCD L33791 criteria
- **Beneficiary height â‰¥6 feet (72 inches) documented**
- Standard walker height inadequate for proper posture causing poor ergonomics *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Extensions needed to prevent back/neck strain *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Requires covered base walker

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- **HEIGHT RESTRICTION: Must document beneficiary height â‰¥6 feet (72 inches)**
- Document current height measurement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain ergonomic need for height adjustment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If provided for beneficiary <6 feet tall, will be DENIED
- Can be used for initial issue with new walker or replacement
- Requires covered base walker
- Proof of Delivery (POD) required

**Important Notes:**
- Height threshold strictly enforced - <6 feet results in denial
- Subject to reasonable replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Billed per set of four (all four legs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Used to achieve proper walker height for tall patients only

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Extends walker legs for taller members per set of four (all four legs)
- **Specific qualifying: Member height â‰¥6 feet tall**
- Standard walker height inadequate for proper posture creating improper mechanics
- Ergonomic need for height adjustment

**Documentation Requirements:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED (# code)
- Original signed fiscal order from authorized practitioner
- **Member height must be documented â‰¥6 feet**
- Must explain ergonomic need for height adjustment
- Current height measurement required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Rental available with -RR modifier
- Frequency: Twice per year *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Height restriction strictly enforced
- Can be used for new walker or existing walker
- Document current walker height and patient height for justification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- DVS authorization valid 180 days

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same height restriction and DVS authorization requirements apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - mobility condition
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting ergonomic need
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Documented height measurement showing â‰¥6 feet (72 inches)**
- [ ] Date of height measurement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Explanation of ergonomic problem with standard walker height *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format
- [ ] Document base walker meets MRADL criteria
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Height documentation showing â‰¥6 feet - failure to document results in denial**
- [ ] Explain improper mechanics or postural problems from standard walker height *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format
- [ ] Submit DVS authorization request via eMedNY
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Member height documented as â‰¥6 feet**
- [ ] Explain ergonomic need and how standard height inadequate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Document current walker height if known *(Under Review)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Height not documented" or "Height <6 feet"** - Most common denial. Patient height not documented or documented as <6 feet. Fix: Include current documented height from recent physical exam showing â‰¥6 feet (72 inches). Document height in feet and inches clearly. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Not medically necessary"** - Extensions described as comfort/preference rather than ergonomic necessity. Fix: Document specific ergonomic problems (e.g., "Patient height 6'3\" requires bending 6 inches to reach standard walker height, causing chronic back strain," or "Patient 75 inches tall, standard walker creates forward flexed posture causing neck pain"). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Base walker not covered"** - Extensions denied because base walker doesn't meet criteria. Fix: Ensure walker meets MRADL criteria. Extensions can only be covered as accessory to covered walker. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Standard walker height would be sufficient"** - Documentation doesn't establish need for height increase. Fix: Document patient height, standard walker height (typically adjusts to ~38-40 inches), explain gap requiring extensions for proper ergonomics. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Convenience item"** - Perceived as non-medical enhancement. Fix: Document medical necessity - proper walker height prevents musculoskeletal strain, enables correct posture and gait mechanics. Not for convenience. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Height documentation is non-negotiable** - must show â‰¥6 feet (72 inches) from clinical measurement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include date of height measurement *(Under Review)*
- Document in feet and inches clearly (e.g., "6'2\", 74 inches") *(Under Review)*
- Explain specific ergonomic problem - quantify height difference if possible *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If patient near 6-foot threshold, document clearly â‰¥6 feet to avoid denial *(Under Review)*
- Document posture problems or musculoskeletal complaints from low walker height *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Obtain height documentation from recent physician visit** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include height measurement in fiscal order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit DVS authorization early - 180-day validity window *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific ergonomic need - how does current walker height affect posture/gait? *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If patient has back/neck pain, document relationship to walker height *(Under Review)*
- Rental option available with -RR modifier if appropriate *(Under Review)*

**Height Measurement Tips:**
- Use recent clinical height measurement (within last year recommended) *(Under Review)*
- Document measurement method (stadiometer, tape measure against wall) *(Under Review)*
- For patients with height loss due to aging, use current height not historical *(Under Review)*
- Be precise - round up if patient is 71.8" to avoid denial at threshold *(Under Review)*
