# E1037 - Transport Chair, Pediatric

## Clinical Overview

The E1037 is a pediatric-sized transport chair designed for pediatric patients with mobility limitations who cannot self-propel and require caregiver propulsion. This is appropriate for children with congenital or developmental conditions affecting mobility, such as cerebral palsy or spina bifida.

**Caregiver-Propelled:** Unlike standard wheelchairs designed for self-propulsion, E1037 transport chairs are designed to be pushed by a caregiver. Patient cannot self-propel due to age, developmental stage, or medical condition.

**Pediatric Sizing:** E1037 is specifically sized for pediatric patients, requiring documentation of current measurements and anticipated growth trajectory.

**Billing:** E1037 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Pediatric patient with mobility limitation requiring caregiver propulsion
- Patient cannot self-propel
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
- Cannot be resolved by cane/walker
- **Caregiver documented as available/willing/able to propel**
- Pediatric sizing appropriate for patient's current measurements

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Manual Wheelchair Bases)
- **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months before Standard Written Order (SWO)
- SWO before delivery required
- Document MRADL impairment (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- Document why patient cannot self-propel
- **Document caregiver availability, willingness, and ability to propel chair**
- **Document pediatric sizing and growth potential**
- **No specialty PT/OT evaluation required**
- Medical records supporting mobility limitation and caregiver availability

**Important Notes:**
- Capped rental: 13 months, then ownership transfers *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Reasonable useful lifetime: 5 years *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May allow earlier replacement for pediatric growth *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F2F exam must document comprehensive mobility assessment and caregiver capability

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same clinical criteria as Medicare
- Pediatric mobility limitation requiring caregiver propulsion
- Patient cannot self-propel
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home AND/OR community
- **Caregiver available/willing/able to propel chair in required environments**

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **Prior approval REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face exam required
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner before delivery
- **Home assessment required** - on-site evaluation verifying adequate access for transport chair use
- Document MRADL impairment in home and/or community
- **Document caregiver availability, willingness, and ability** to propel in required settings
- **Document pediatric sizing** - current measurements and growth trajectory
- Covers home AND/OR community use

**Important Notes:**
- Frequency: F3 - Once every 5 years *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **May allow earlier replacement for pediatric growth** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Capped rental: 13 months, then ownership transfers
- Prior approval required before delivery
- Caregiver must be physically able to propel chair and willing to provide assistance

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same prior approval, home assessment, caregiver documentation, and pediatric sizing requirements apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - pediatric mobility condition (G80.x, Q05.x, Z99.3, etc.)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Document why patient cannot self-propel
- [ ] **Document caregiver availability (who), willingness (commitment), and ability (physical capability)**
- [ ] **Document pediatric sizing** - current height, weight, measurements
- [ ] **Document growth trajectory** - anticipated growth pattern *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam within 6 months before SWO**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format before delivery
- [ ] Document MRADL limitations in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- [ ] Comprehensive mobility assessment showing patient cannot self-propel
- [ ] Caregiver assessment showing availability, willingness, and physical ability to propel

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Submit prior approval request via eMedNY** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Face-to-face exam documented
- [ ] Fiscal order format before delivery
- [ ] **Home assessment** - on-site evaluation of home environment and caregiver capability
- [ ] Document home AND/OR community mobility needs with caregiver propulsion
- [ ] Pediatric measurements and growth considerations

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No caregiver documented"** - Most common error for transport chairs. Prescription doesn't document caregiver availability, willingness, and ability to propel chair. Fix: **Document all three elements:** (1) **Availability** - identify specific caregiver(s) by relationship (parent, family member, aide); (2) **Willingness** - caregiver commitment to providing propulsion assistance; (3) **Ability** - caregiver physical capability to push chair (no physical limitations preventing propulsion). All three required per source. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Patient can self-propel - standard wheelchair appropriate"** - Documentation suggests patient has capability to self-propel, making transport chair not medically necessary. Fix: Clearly document why patient **cannot** self-propel due to age, developmental stage, upper extremity limitations, cognitive factors, or medical condition. Explain why caregiver propulsion required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No pediatric sizing documentation"** - Current measurements and pediatric-appropriate sizing not documented. Fix: Include patient's current height, weight, and relevant measurements showing pediatric sizing appropriate. Document growth trajectory for anticipated future sizing needs. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No F2F exam documented"** - Face-to-face exam not documented or not within 6-month timeframe. Fix: Document F2F exam date within 6 months before SWO/fiscal order. Include comprehensive mobility assessment and caregiver capability evaluation in exam notes. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before prior approval received. Fix: Submit and receive Medicaid prior approval before ordering/delivering transport chair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document caregiver thoroughly** - availability (identify caregiver), willingness (commitment), ability (physical capability) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain why patient cannot self-propel due to pediatric/medical factors *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document pediatric sizing with current measurements *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include growth trajectory to support pediatric need *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F2F exam must assess both patient mobility limitations and caregiver capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO before delivery - ensure all required elements included *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Submit prior approval early** - allow time for review before delivery needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment required** - schedule on-site evaluation to verify caregiver capability in home environment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document caregiver availability, willingness, and ability for home/community use *(Under Review)*
- Include pediatric measurements and growth considerations *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If anticipating growth requiring earlier replacement, document growth trajectory *(Under Review)*
- Fiscal order before delivery with all required documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Pediatric Growth Considerations:**
- Document current size and anticipated growth pattern *(Under Review)*
- May request earlier replacement if child outgrows chair before 5-year RUL *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include developmental milestones that may affect mobility needs *(Under Review)*
