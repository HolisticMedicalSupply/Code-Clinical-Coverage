# E1038 - Transport Chair, Adult (≤300 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

The E1038 is an adult-sized transport chair for patients up to and including 300 lbs weight capacity, designed for patients with mobility limitations requiring caregiver propulsion. This is appropriate for adults who cannot safely self-propel or for whom self-propulsion is not medically appropriate due to conditions such as hemiplegia, paralysis, or significant muscle weakness.

**Caregiver-Propelled:** Unlike standard wheelchairs designed for self-propulsion, E1038 transport chairs are designed to be pushed by a caregiver. Patient cannot or should not self-propel due to medical condition, safety concerns, or functional limitations.

**Weight Capacity:** E1038 is for patients ≤300 lbs. Patients >300 lbs require E1039 (heavy duty transport chair).

**Billing:** E1038 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

- Caregiver must be physically able to propel chair and willing to provide assistance

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same prior approval, home assessment, caregiver documentation, and transport vs. standard justification requirements apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - mobility condition (G81.x, G82.x, M62.81, Z99.3, etc.)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Document why patient cannot or should not self-propel
- [ ] **Document patient weight ≤300 lbs**
- [ ] **Document caregiver availability (who), willingness (commitment), and ability (physical capability)**
- [ ] **If patient has UE function, justify why transport chair vs. standard wheelchair** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam within 6 months before SWO**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format before delivery
- [ ] Document MRADL limitations in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- [ ] Comprehensive mobility assessment showing patient cannot safely self-propel
- [ ] Caregiver assessment showing availability, willingness, and physical ability to propel
- [ ] Weight documentation ≤300 lbs

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Submit prior approval request via eMedNY**
- [ ] Face-to-face exam documented
- [ ] Fiscal order format before delivery
- [ ] **Home assessment** - on-site evaluation of home environment and caregiver capability
- [ ] Document home AND/OR community mobility needs with caregiver propulsion
- [ ] **Justify transport vs. standard wheelchair** - especially if patient has UE function

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient can self-propel - standard wheelchair appropriate"** - Most common error for transport chairs. Documentation suggests patient has upper extremity capability to self-propel, making transport chair not medically necessary. Fix: Clearly document why patient **cannot or should not** self-propel due to: UE paralysis/severe weakness (hemiplegia, quadriplegia), cognitive impairment preventing safe self-propulsion, medical condition making self-propulsion contraindicated (cardiac, pulmonary restrictions), or safety concerns. **Justify transport vs. standard wheelchair** per source requirement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No caregiver documented"** - Prescription doesn't document caregiver availability, willingness, and ability to propel chair. Fix: **Document all three elements:** (1) **Availability** - identify specific caregiver(s) by relationship (spouse, family member, aide); (2) **Willingness** - caregiver commitment to providing propulsion assistance; (3) **Ability** - caregiver physical capability to push chair (no physical limitations preventing propulsion). All three required for transport chair coverage. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Weight exceeds 300 lbs"** - Patient weight documented as >300 lbs, exceeding E1038 capacity. Fix: If patient >300 lbs, use E1039 (heavy duty transport chair, >300 lbs capacity). Accurately document patient weight. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No justification for transport vs. standard wheelchair"** (Medicaid) - Medicaid source specifically requires justification for transport vs. standard chair. Prescription doesn't explain why transport (caregiver-propelled) necessary instead of standard (self-propelled) wheelchair. Fix: Provide detailed explanation why caregiver propulsion necessary and self-propulsion not appropriate due to patient's medical condition, functional limitations, or safety concerns. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before prior approval received. Fix: Submit and receive Medicaid prior approval before ordering/delivering transport chair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document caregiver thoroughly** - availability (identify caregiver), willingness (commitment), ability (physical capability) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify transport vs. standard wheelchair** - explain why self-propulsion not appropriate even if patient has some UE function *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific medical reasons patient cannot safely self-propel (paralysis, weakness, cognitive impairment, contraindication) *(Under Review)*
- Document patient weight ≤300 lbs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F2F exam must assess both patient mobility limitations and caregiver capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO before delivery - ensure all required elements included *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Submit prior approval early** - allow time for review before delivery needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment required** - schedule on-site evaluation to verify caregiver capability in home environment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify transport vs. standard chair** - source specifically requires this justification for Medicaid *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document caregiver availability, willingness, and ability for home/community use *(Under Review)*
- Explain why caregiver propulsion medically necessary vs. self-propulsion *(Under Review)*
- Document patient weight ≤300 lbs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order before delivery with all required documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Common Justifications for Transport vs. Standard Wheelchair:**
- Bilateral UE paralysis preventing self-propulsion (quadriplegia, bilateral stroke) *(Under Review)*
- Severe bilateral UE weakness insufficient for safe self-propulsion *(Under Review)*
- Cognitive impairment preventing safe wheelchair operation *(Under Review)*
- Medical contraindication to self-propulsion (cardiac, pulmonary conditions) *(Under Review)*
- Safety concerns with self-propulsion attempts *(Under Review)*
