# K0002 - Standard Hemi-Wheelchair (Low Seat)

## Clinical Overview

The K0002 is a standard hemi-wheelchair with lower seat height (17-18 inches) designed for patients who require foot contact with the floor for propulsion. This is appropriate for short stature individuals OR patients with hemiplegia who use unilateral foot propulsion, as well as lower extremity amputees requiring foot propulsion with prosthesis or residual limb.

**Lower Seat Height:** K0002 seat height is 17-18 inches (vs. standard 19-21" for K0001), allowing patient's feet to reach floor for propulsion. Critical for patients who propel wheelchair with one or both feet rather than hand rims.

**"Hemi" Designation:** Originally designed for hemiplegia patients with unilateral foot propulsion, but also appropriate for short stature individuals requiring lower seat for proper positioning, and amputees using foot propulsion.

**Billing:** K0002 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No justification for lower seat vs. standard seat"** - Most common error for K0002. Prescription doesn't explain why lower seat height (17-18") medically necessary instead of standard seat height (K0001). Fix: **Document specific reason for lower seat:** (1) **Short stature** - patient measurements (height, inseam, leg length) showing standard seat height places feet off floor, preventing proper positioning; (2) **Foot propulsion** - functional assessment showing patient propels wheelchair with one or both feet, requiring lower seat for foot-floor contact; (3) **Hemiplegia** - unilateral foot propulsion as primary mobility method; (4) **Disarticulation** - lower seat required for residual limb positioning/propulsion. Include patient measurements demonstrating lower seat medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No patient measurements documented"** - Prescription requests K0002 but doesn't include patient measurements justifying lower seat. Fix: Document **specific measurements:** patient height (inches), inseam length (floor to crotch), leg length, showing standard 19-21" seat height inappropriate and 17-18" seat height medically necessary. Measurements must support lower seat justification. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No functional assessment for foot propulsion"** - Prescription states patient uses foot propulsion but doesn't provide functional assessment. Fix: Document **functional assessment:** observe/document patient's ability to foot-propel wheelchair; describe propulsion method (unilateral/bilateral foot propulsion); document why foot propulsion medically necessary (hemiplegia, amputation, upper extremity limitations preventing handrim use); assess safe foot propulsion capability. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Standard K0001 appropriate"** - Reviewer determines standard seat height K0001 would be adequate based on documentation. Fix: Clearly document why **standard K0001 insufficient:** patient's specific measurements require lower seat; foot propulsion requires foot-floor contact not possible with standard seat; short stature prevents proper positioning in standard height seat. Include comparative measurements (standard vs. hemi seat height) showing medical necessity. *(Under Review)*

5. **"No F2F exam documented"** - Face-to-face exam not documented or not within 6-month timeframe. Fix: Document F2F exam date within 6 months before SWO/fiscal order. Include comprehensive mobility assessment with foot propulsion evaluation and measurements in exam notes. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

- **Document specific need for lower seat** with clinical rationale (short stature, foot propulsion, hemiplegia, disarticulation) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Include patient measurements** - height, inseam, leg length showing why 17-18" seat necessary vs. standard 19-21" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Functional assessment for foot propulsion** - observe and document foot propulsion capability if applicable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain why standard K0001 seat height inadequate for patient's needs *(Under Review)*
- Rule out cane/walker with functional documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document MRADL impairment in home *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **NO prior authorization needed** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F2F exam must include measurements and functional assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO before delivery - ensure all required elements included *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **NO prior approval required** for K0002 - simplifies process *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment required** - schedule on-site evaluation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document patient measurements** justifying lower seat height *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Functional assessment for foot propulsion** if applicable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain why standard K0001 insufficient *(Under Review)*
- Document MRADL impairment for home AND/OR community use *(Under Review)*
- **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order before delivery with all required documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Measurement Best Practices:**
- Measure patient height in inches *(Under Review)*
- Measure inseam length (floor to crotch while standing/sitting) *(Under Review)*
- Calculate appropriate seat height: typically inseam minus 2" *(Under Review)*
- Document measurements show 17-18" seat appropriate, standard 19-21" inappropriate *(Under Review)*
- Include measurements in F2F exam notes *(Under Review)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios for K0002:**
- Hemiplegia patient using unilateral foot propulsion as primary mobility *(verified from source)*
- Short stature patient (height <5'4") requiring lower seat for proper positioning *(Under Review)*
- Lower extremity amputee using foot/prosthesis for propulsion *(verified from source - disarticulation)*
- Patient with bilateral UE impairment using foot propulsion *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **K0001** - Standard wheelchair (use if standard seat height 19-21" appropriate)
- **K0003** - Lightweight wheelchair (if patient needs lighter chair for propulsion)
- **K0004** - High strength lightweight (for higher activity level with hemi seat - rare combination)
- **E1038** - Transport chair, adult (if patient cannot foot-propel and needs caregiver propulsion)
