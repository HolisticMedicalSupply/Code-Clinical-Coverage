# K0006 - Heavy Duty Wheelchair (>250 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

The K0006 is a heavy duty wheelchair for patients with weight >250-300 lbs, OR severe spasticity requiring reinforced construction, OR body measurements exceeding standard wheelchair capacity. This wheelchair features heavy duty components (reinforced frame, braces, bars, upholstery, wheels) to accommodate higher weight or severe spasticity forces.

**Three Pathways to K0006 Coverage:**

**Pathway 1 (Weight-Based - Most Common):** Patient weight >250 lbs (up to 300 lbs maximum for K0006; >300 lbs requires K0007)

**Pathway 2 (Spasticity-Based):** Severe spasticity requiring heavy duty construction to withstand spasticity forces, even if weight â‰¤250 lbs

**Pathway 3 (Measurement-Based):** Body measurements (chest, hips, thighs, not purely weight) exceed standard wheelchair capacity

**Weight Capacity Range:** K0006 covers 250-300 lbs. Patients >300 lbs require K0007 (extra heavy duty).

**Billing:** K0006 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

## Coverage Details

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - obesity (E66.x), BMI (Z68.4x), spasticity (G82.x, G80.x), wheelchair dependence (Z99.3), etc.
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] **Choose and document ONE pathway:**

**PATHWAY 1 (Weight - Most Common):**
- [ ] **Document patient weight >250 lbs** (current actual weight in pounds)
- [ ] Verify weight does not exceed 300 lbs (if >300 lbs, use K0007 instead)

**PATHWAY 2 (Spasticity):**
- [ ] **Document severe spasticity** - describe severity, muscle groups affected
- [ ] **ICD-10 with spasticity** (G82.x, G80.x)
- [ ] Explain why heavy duty construction required to withstand spasticity forces

**PATHWAY 3 (Measurements):**
- [ ] **Document body measurements** (chest, hips, thighs) exceeding standard wheelchair capacity
- [ ] Distinguish from pure weight indication

**Plus General Requirements:**
- [ ] Rule out cane/walker
- [ ] Document self-propulsion capability OR caregiver availability
- [ ] Explain why standard K0001-K0004 inadequate for patient's needs
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam within 6 months before SWO**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format before delivery
- [ ] Document MRADL limitations in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- [ ] Weight OR spasticity OR measurements clearly documented
- [ ] **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] **NO prior authorization needed** (Medicare) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Submit prior approval request** (likely required for K0006) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Face-to-face exam documented
- [ ] Fiscal order format before delivery
- [ ] **Home assessment** - on-site evaluation of home environment for heavy duty wheelchair
- [ ] Document home AND/OR community mobility needs
- [ ] Weight OR spasticity OR measurements pathway clearly documented
- [ ] **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Weight â‰¤250 lbs - standard wheelchair appropriate"** - Most common error for K0006 weight-based pathway. Patient weight documented as â‰¤250 lbs, making standard wheelchair (K0001-K0004) appropriate (not heavy duty K0006). Fix: **Accurately document current patient weight >250 lbs** - must exceed 250 lb threshold for weight-based K0006 coverage. Use recent weight measurement (within 3 months). If patient â‰¤250 lbs, standard wheelchair K0001-K0004 appropriate unless severe spasticity or measurement indication documented. Weight must be >250 lbs but â‰¤300 lbs for K0006 (>300 lbs requires K0007). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No justification for heavy duty vs. standard wheelchair"** - Prescription requests K0006 but doesn't clearly document why heavy duty construction necessary vs. standard wheelchair. Fix: **Document specific heavy duty indication:** **PATHWAY 1** (most common): Weight >250 lbs exceeds standard wheelchair capacity, reinforced components required. **PATHWAY 2**: Severe spasticity generates forces exceeding standard wheelchair tolerance, heavy duty frame/components required to prevent damage. **PATHWAY 3**: Body measurements (chest, hips, thighs) exceed standard wheelchair seat/back dimensions. Explain why standard K0001-K0004 inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Weight exceeds 300 lbs - K0007 required"** - Patient weight documented as >300 lbs, exceeding K0006 capacity. Fix: K0006 covers 250-300 lbs only. If patient weight >300 lbs, use **K0007 (extra heavy duty)** instead of K0006. Accurately document weight and select appropriate code: K0001-K0004 (â‰¤250 lbs), K0006 (250-300 lbs), K0007 (>300 lbs). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Severe spasticity not documented"** (Pathway 2) - Prescription states "spasticity" but doesn't document severity or why heavy duty construction required. Fix: If using spasticity pathway, **document SEVERE spasticity** - describe severity level, muscle groups affected (trunk, extremities), spasticity impact on wheelchair (previous wheelchair damage, standard wheelchair inadequate). Include appropriate ICD-10 (G82.x with spasticity, G80.x cerebral palsy). Explain why standard wheelchair construction insufficient to withstand spasticity forces and heavy duty reinforcement required. Spasticity must be severe enough to justify heavy duty construction. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before prior approval received. Fix: Submit and receive Medicaid prior approval before ordering/delivering K0006 heavy duty wheelchair (likely required). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- Verify weight >250 lbs but â‰¤300 lbs for K0006 range *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If weight borderline near 250 lbs, verify calculation accurate *(Under Review)*
- Include BMI ICD-10 codes (Z68.4x) if applicable *(verified from source)*

**Spasticity Documentation Best Practices (Pathway 2):**
- Document SEVERE spasticity - mild/moderate insufficient for heavy duty *(Under Review)*
- Describe muscle groups affected and spasticity impact *(Under Review)*
- Explain forces generated require heavy duty construction *(Under Review)*
- Include appropriate ICD-10: G82.x (paralysis with spasticity), G80.x (cerebral palsy) *(verified from source)*
- Document standard wheelchair inadequacy due to spasticity *(Under Review)*

**Measurement Documentation Best Practices (Pathway 3):**
- Document specific measurements: chest width, hip width, thigh circumference *(Under Review)*
- Explain how measurements exceed standard wheelchair seat/back dimensions *(Under Review)*
- Distinguish from pure weight indication (Pathway 1) *(Under Review)*
- Verify heavy duty accommodates measurements where standard cannot *(Under Review)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios for K0006:**
- Obesity with weight 250-300 lbs requiring weight capacity beyond standard *(verified from source)*
- Severe spasticity (cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury) generating forces requiring reinforcement *(verified from source)*
- Bariatric patients with body measurements exceeding standard wheelchair *(verified from source)*
- Combined weight and spasticity requiring heavy duty construction *(Under Review)*

- **K0001** - Standard wheelchair (use if weight â‰¤250 lbs and no spasticity/measurement indication)
- **K0007** - Extra heavy duty wheelchair, >300 lbs (use if weight >300 lbs)
- **K0004** - High strength lightweight (activity-based, not weight-based like K0006)
- **E1039** - Transport chair, heavy duty, >300 lbs (caregiver-propelled bariatric alternative)

**NOTE:** Heavy duty wheelchair for weight >250-300 lbs OR severe spasticity OR body measurements exceeding standard. THREE pathways: weight (most common), spasticity, or measurements. Document weight >250 lbs OR severe spasticity with ICD-10. NO specialty PT/OT evaluation required. Prior approval likely required for Medicaid.
