# K0001 - Standard Wheelchair

## Clinical Overview

The K0001 is the most commonly prescribed standard manual wheelchair base code. This is the baseline wheelchair for patients who can self-propel OR have a caregiver, with standard dimensions (≥15" seat) and weight capacity up to 250 lbs. K0001 represents the least costly medically appropriate wheelchair option.

**Most Common Base Code:** K0001 is the standard baseline wheelchair. If patient needs justify more advanced features (lightweight, high strength, heavy duty, custom), use appropriate upgraded codes (K0002-K0009) with additional justification.

**Self-Propel OR Caregiver:** Unlike transport chairs (E1037-E1039) which require caregiver propulsion, K0001 can be used by patients who self-propel OR by those with caregiver assistance.

**Standard Dimensions:** Seat width ≥15". Standard adult sizing. Weight capacity ≤250 lbs.

**Billing:** K0001 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - mobility condition (Z99.3, R26.2, G82.x, G81.x, M62.81, etc.)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] **Rule out cane/walker** - document why less costly alternatives insufficient
- [ ] Document self-propulsion capability OR caregiver availability
- [ ] Patient weight ≤250 lbs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Standard dimensions (≥15" seat) appropriate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam within 6 months before SWO**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format before delivery
- [ ] Document MRADL limitations in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- [ ] Comprehensive mobility assessment showing cane/walker insufficient
- [ ] **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed** (simplifies process)
- [ ] **NO prior authorization needed** (simplifies process)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **NO prior approval needed** for standard K0001 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Face-to-face exam documented
- [ ] Fiscal order format before delivery
- [ ] **Home assessment** - on-site evaluation of home environment for wheelchair
- [ ] Document home AND/OR community mobility needs
- [ ] Rule out cane/walker with documentation of inadequacy
- [ ] **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed**

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Cane/walker not ruled out"** - Most common error for K0001. Prescription doesn't document why less costly alternatives (cane, walker) are insufficient for patient's mobility needs. Fix: **Document why cane/walker inadequate:** specific functional assessment showing patient cannot safely ambulate with cane/walker for MRADLs in home; distance limitations; fall risk; upper/lower extremity limitations preventing safe use; tried cane/walker but insufficient. Must show wheelchair is **least costly medically appropriate** option after ruling out alternatives. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No MRADL impairment documented"** - Prescription doesn't document how mobility limitation affects specific Mobility-Related Activities of Daily Living in home. Fix: Document specific MRADL impairment: toileting (cannot access bathroom safely without wheelchair), feeding (cannot access kitchen/dining), dressing (cannot navigate home to dressing area), grooming (cannot access bathroom sink), bathing (cannot access shower/bath). Be specific about home mobility limitations. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Weight exceeds 250 lbs"** - Patient weight documented as >250 lbs, requiring heavy duty wheelchair instead of standard K0001. Fix: If patient >250 lbs, use K0006 (>250-300 lbs) or K0007 (>300 lbs) with appropriate weight documentation. K0001 only appropriate for patients ≤250 lbs. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No F2F exam documented"** - Face-to-face exam not documented or not within 6-month timeframe. Fix: Document F2F exam date within 6 months before SWO/fiscal order. Include comprehensive mobility assessment in exam notes. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Upgraded wheelchair not justified"** - If prescription requests K0003-K0009 instead of K0001, must justify why standard K0001 inadequate. Fix: If patient needs only standard wheelchair features, use K0001 (baseline). If upgraded features needed (lightweight K0003, high strength K0004, heavy duty K0006+), provide specific justification why K0001 insufficient. K0001 is least costly appropriate option. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Rule out cane/walker thoroughly** - document functional assessment showing why less costly alternatives insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific MRADL impairment in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Verify patient weight ≤250 lbs (if >250 lbs, use K0006/K0007 instead) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed** - simplifies documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **NO prior authorization needed** - can proceed directly to SWO *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F2F exam must assess mobility limitations and demonstrate wheelchair medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO before delivery - ensure all required elements included *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **NO prior approval required** for standard K0001 - major advantage over upgraded codes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment required** - schedule on-site evaluation to verify wheelchair fits home environment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Rule out cane/walker with functional documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document MRADL impairment for home AND/OR community use *(Under Review)*
- Verify standard dimensions (≥15" seat) appropriate for patient *(Under Review)*
- Verify weight ≤250 lbs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **NO specialty PT/OT evaluation needed** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order before delivery with all required documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**K0001 as Baseline Code:**
- K0001 is the **most commonly prescribed** wheelchair base *(verified from source)*
- Represents **least costly medically appropriate** wheelchair option *(Under Review)*
- If patient needs only basic wheelchair features, K0001 appropriate *(Under Review)*
- If upgraded features needed, justify why K0001 insufficient and use appropriate upgraded code *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **K0003** - Lightweight wheelchair (for patients who cannot propel K0001 but can propel lighter chair)
- **K0004** - High strength lightweight (for higher activity level, ≥2 hrs/day use, non-standard sizing)
- **K0006** - Heavy duty wheelchair, >250 lbs (for patients exceeding K0001 weight capacity)
