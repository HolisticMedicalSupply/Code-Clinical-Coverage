# E1031 - Rollabout Chair

## Clinical Overview

The E1031 is a rollabout chair with casters 5" or greater, designed as an alternative mobility device when a standard wheelchair is not appropriate for the patient's specific mobility needs. This meets the same general wheelchair coverage criteria requiring mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing) in the home that cannot be resolved by cane or walker.

**Alternative Mobility Device:** E1031 is used when standard wheelchairs (K0001-K0009) are not appropriate due to specific patient functional needs, environmental requirements, or medical conditions. May require justification if patient already has another wheelchair.

**Billing:** E1031 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
- Cannot be resolved by cane or walker
- Patient can self-propel OR has caregiver available/willing/able
- Specific medical need for rollabout chair vs. standard wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Manual Wheelchair Bases)
- **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months before Standard Written Order (SWO)
- SWO before delivery required
- Document MRADL impairment (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- Document why cane/walker insufficient

- Reasonable useful lifetime: 5 years *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F2F exam must document comprehensive mobility assessment
- Not appropriate if standard wheelchair (K0001-K0009) meets patient needs

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same clinical criteria as Medicare
- Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home AND/OR community
- Cannot be resolved by cane or walker
- Patient can self-propel OR has caregiver available/willing/able

- Document why rollabout chair medically necessary vs. standard wheelchair
- Covers home AND/OR community use

**Important Notes:**
- Frequency: F3 - Once every 5 years *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Capped rental: 13 months, then ownership transfers
- Prior approval required before delivery

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - mobility limitation (Z99.3, Z74.09, R26.2, condition-specific)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] **Justification for rollabout chair vs. standard wheelchair** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Document why cane/walker insufficient
- [ ] Document self-propulsion ability OR caregiver availability
- [ ] If patient has existing wheelchair, justify need for rollabout as alternative *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam within 6 months before SWO**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format before delivery
- [ ] Document MRADL limitations in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- [ ] Comprehensive mobility assessment showing why rollabout needed vs. standard wheelchair

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Submit prior approval request via eMedNY** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Face-to-face exam documented
- [ ] Fiscal order format before delivery
- [ ] **Home assessment** - on-site evaluation of home environment
- [ ] Document home AND/OR community mobility needs
- [ ] Specific justification for rollabout chair design vs. standard wheelchair

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No justification for rollabout vs. standard wheelchair"** - Most common error. Prescription doesn't explain why rollabout chair specifically needed instead of standard wheelchair (K0001-K0009). Fix: Clearly document specific functional, medical, or environmental reasons why standard wheelchair inadequate and rollabout chair design required. Examples: specific transfer method requiring rollabout design, home environment unsuitable for standard wheelchair, medical condition requiring rollabout positioning. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Patient already has wheelchair - no justification for second device"** - Patient has existing wheelchair and prescription doesn't explain need for rollabout as alternative/replacement. Fix: If patient has existing wheelchair, document specific medical reason for rollabout chair (replacement due to wear, different device for specific environment/activities, medical condition change requiring alternative mobility device). Reference existing wheelchair and explain why rollabout necessary. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No F2F exam documented"** - Face-to-face exam not documented or not within 6-month timeframe. Fix: Document F2F exam date within 6 months before SWO/fiscal order. Include comprehensive mobility assessment in exam notes. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Standard wheelchair would meet needs"** - Reviewer determines standard wheelchair (K0001-K0009) would be adequate based on documentation. Fix: Provide detailed functional assessment showing specific reasons why standard wheelchair design cannot meet patient's mobility needs and rollabout chair design is medically necessary. *(Under Review)*

5. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before prior approval received. Fix: Submit and receive Medicaid prior approval before ordering/delivering rollabout chair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document specific justification** for rollabout chair vs. standard wheelchair design *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- F2F exam must include comprehensive mobility assessment showing why standard wheelchair inadequate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain functional/medical/environmental factors requiring rollabout design *(Under Review)*
- If patient has existing wheelchair, clearly document why rollabout needed as alternative/replacement *(Under Review)*
- SWO before delivery - ensure all required elements included *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Submit prior approval early** - allow time for review before delivery needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment required** - schedule on-site evaluation to document environment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Clearly justify rollabout design vs. standard wheelchair for home/community use *(Under Review)*
- Document specific functional advantages of rollabout for patient's MRADLs *(Under Review)*
- If patient has existing wheelchair, explain medical necessity for rollabout as alternative device *(Under Review)*
- Fiscal order before delivery with all required documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
