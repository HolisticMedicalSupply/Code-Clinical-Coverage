# K0008 - Custom Manual Wheelchair/Base

## Clinical Overview

The K0008 is a custom manual wheelchair/base for patients with complex neurological or musculoskeletal conditions whose physical and functional deficits CANNOT be met using standard or modular wheelchairs (K0001-K0007) even with accessories. K0008 requires individual construction from unique patient measurements - true custom fabrication, not modular assembly.

**VERY HIGH SCRUTINY:** Source explicitly states K0008 receives "very high scrutiny on custom designation" - this is the most complex and heavily reviewed manual wheelchair code, requiring the most comprehensive documentation and justification.

**True Custom Fabrication Required:** K0008 is NOT for wheelchairs assembled from modular components. Must prove wheelchair requires individual custom fabrication from unique measurements due to complex body geometry, severe contractures, or skeletal deformities that modular systems cannot accommodate.

**Critical Requirements:**
- **SPECIALTY EVALUATION REQUIRED:** PT/OT with rehab training, NO financial relationship with supplier
- **RESNA ATP REQUIRED:** Supplier must employ RESNA-certified ATP with direct involvement
- **Comprehensive evaluation:** Document why EVERY code K0001-K0007 plus accessories insufficient
- **KU modifier:** Required for custom wheelchair
- **ADMC strongly recommended:** Advance Determination of Medicare Coverage (voluntary prior approval)

**Billing:** K0008 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Modular wheelchair with accessories would be adequate - custom not medically necessary"** - Most common error for K0008. Prescription doesn't prove why modular wheelchairs (K0001-K0007) with appropriate accessories cannot meet patient needs, making true custom fabrication not medically necessary. Fix: **Must systematically document why EVERY modular option insufficient per source:** For EACH code K0001-K0007, explain specific reason inadequate (sizing, configuration, strength, adjustability, etc.); document accessories considered (positioning supports, custom seating, etc.) and why accessories with modular base cannot achieve required configuration; **prove true custom fabrication required** - unique measurements, complex body geometry, severe contractures, or skeletal deformities that modular systems physically cannot accommodate; explain custom frame specifications needed that don't exist in modular options. **Very high scrutiny on custom designation per source** - weak justification will be denied. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No specialty evaluation or evaluator has financial relationship with supplier"** - K0008 requires specialty evaluation by PT/OT with NO financial relationship with supplier. Prescription lacks specialty evaluation OR evaluator has financial relationship. Fix: **SPECIALTY EVALUATION REQUIRED per source** - must be conducted by PT/OT (LCMP) with specific rehab/wheelchair training; evaluator must have **NO financial relationship with supplier** (employee, commission, referral arrangement); **signed attestation required** documenting no financial relationship; evaluation must be comprehensive, documenting custom necessity and why K0001-K0007 insufficient. Evaluator employed by or financially affiliated with supplier disqualifies evaluation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No RESNA ATP involvement"** - K0008 requires RESNA-certified ATP involvement. Prescription doesn't document ATP involvement or ATP not RESNA-certified. Fix: **RESNA ATP REQUIRED per source** - supplier must employ ATP with current RESNA certification; ATP must have **direct involvement** in evaluation and wheelchair specification (not just passive review); document ATP's RESNA certification number and direct participation; ATP report/specifications must be included. RESNA ATP is REQUIRED, not optional. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Not true custom fabrication - modular assembly"** - Prescription describes wheelchair that is modular components assembled, not true custom fabrication. Fix: **Prove true custom fabrication per source** - wheelchair requires individual construction from unique patient measurements, not assembly of modular components; custom frame welding/fabrication required (not modular frame with accessories); complex body geometry, severe contractures, or skeletal deformities require custom frame design; measurements and specifications show configurations impossible with modular systems. K0008 is for TRUE custom, not "custom-configured" modular wheelchairs. Distinguish custom fabrication from modular customization. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No prior approval / No ADMC"** - (Medicaid) Delivered before prior approval received. (Medicare) ADMC not submitted - denied post-fabrication due to insufficient justification. Fix: **Medicaid:** Prior approval REQUIRED before custom fabrication - submit comprehensive documentation and receive approval. **Medicare:** ADMC (voluntary prior approval) STRONGLY RECOMMENDED per source given very high scrutiny and high cost - submit ADMC before expensive custom fabrication to avoid denial after chair built; delivery within 6 months if ADMC approved. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Related Codes

- **K0005** - Ultra-lightweight wheelchair (also requires specialty eval/ATP but modular, not custom)
- **K0001-K0007** - Standard/modular manual wheelchairs (must document inadequacy of ALL these codes for K0008)
- **K0009** - Other manual wheelchair (for unusual wheelchairs not fitting other codes - less stringent than K0008 custom)
- **K0013** - Custom power wheelchair base (powered equivalent of K0008)
