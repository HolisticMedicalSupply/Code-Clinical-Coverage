# K0007 - Extra Heavy Duty Wheelchair (>300 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

The K0007 is an extra heavy duty wheelchair for morbidly obese patients with weight >300-450+ lbs, with body measurements exceeding K0006 heavy duty capacity. This wheelchair features extra heavy duty construction with maximally reinforced components (frame, braces, bars, upholstery, wheels, axles) to accommodate extreme weight capacity requirements.

**Weight Threshold:** K0007 is for patients >300 lbs. Weight range typically 300-450+ lbs depending on specific wheelchair model capacity. Patients ≤300 lbs should use K0006 (heavy duty) or lighter codes.

**Measurements Exceed K0006:** Must document that patient's weight AND measurements exceed what K0006 (heavy duty, 250-300 lb capacity) can accommodate. K0007 is the highest weight tier for manual wheelchairs.

**Weight Capacity Verification Essential:** Source emphasizes verifying wheelchair weight capacity rating matches or exceeds patient's actual weight.

**Billing:** K0007 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Weight ≤300 lbs - K0006 appropriate"** - Most common error for K0007. Patient weight documented as ≤300 lbs, making K0006 (heavy duty, 250-300 lbs) appropriate instead of K0007 (extra heavy duty, >300 lbs). Fix: **Accurately document current patient weight >300 lbs** - must clearly exceed 300 lb threshold for K0007 coverage. Use recent weight measurement (within 3 months). K0007 only appropriate when weight exceeds 300 lbs. If borderline near 300 lbs, use K0006. Weight documentation must be precise. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"K0006 would be adequate - no measurements showing K0006 insufficient"** - Prescription documents weight >300 lbs but doesn't demonstrate why K0006 inadequate and K0007 necessary. Fix: **Must document measurements showing K0006 exceeded per source** - patient's body measurements (chest width, hip width, thigh circumference, required seat width/depth) exceed K0006 capacity. Weight >300 lbs alone may not be sufficient - must show K0006 heavy duty construction cannot accommodate patient's size. Document specific measurements and explain why K0006 (250-300 lb capacity) insufficient for patient's >300 lb weight and measurements. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No weight capacity verification"** - Prescription requests K0007 but doesn't verify specific wheelchair weight capacity rating. Fix: **Weight capacity verification essential per source** - specify exact wheelchair model and its weight capacity rating (e.g., "XYZ model wheelchair rated for 500 lbs"); verify capacity rating exceeds patient's actual weight (e.g., "patient weighs 425 lbs, wheelchair capacity 500 lbs provides adequate safety margin"). Critical safety issue - patient weight must not exceed chair capacity. Document verification in prescription. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No documentation why K0006 insufficient"** - Prescription jumps to K0007 without explaining K0006 inadequacy. Fix: Clearly document why **K0006 (250-300 lb capacity) cannot meet patient needs:** patient weight >300 lbs exceeds K0006 maximum capacity; K0006 seat width/depth insufficient for patient's body measurements; K0006 frame/component strength inadequate for patient's weight. Explain progression: standard inadequate → heavy duty K0006 inadequate → extra heavy duty K0007 necessary. *(Under Review)*

5. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before prior approval received. Fix: Submit and receive Medicaid prior approval before ordering/delivering K0007 extra heavy duty wheelchair (REQUIRED). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
