# E1039 - Transport Chair, Heavy Duty (>300 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

The E1039 is a heavy duty adult transport chair for patients greater than 300 lbs weight capacity, designed for bariatric patients with mobility limitations requiring caregiver propulsion. This is appropriate for adults who cannot safely self-propel or for whom self-propulsion is not medically appropriate, and whose weight exceeds the 300 lb capacity of standard transport chair E1038.

**Caregiver-Propelled:** Unlike standard wheelchairs designed for self-propulsion, E1039 transport chairs are designed to be pushed by a caregiver. Patient cannot or should not self-propel due to medical condition, safety concerns, or functional limitations.

**Heavy Duty - Weight Capacity:** E1039 is for patients >300 lbs. Patients ≤300 lbs should use E1038 (standard transport chair). Heavy duty construction with reinforced frame, upholstery, and components to accommodate higher weight.

**Billing:** E1039 billed per unit (1 chair). Covered under capped rental: 13-month rental period, then ownership transfers to patient.

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Same prior approval, home assessment, caregiver documentation, and transport vs. standard justification requirements apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - obesity (E66.x) plus mobility condition (G81.x, G82.x, M62.81, Z99.3, etc.)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Document why patient cannot or should not self-propel
- [ ] **Document patient weight >300 lbs** (current actual weight)
- [ ] **Document caregiver availability (who), willingness (commitment), and PHYSICAL ABILITY to propel heavy duty chair**
- [ ] **If patient has UE function, justify why transport chair vs. standard wheelchair** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam within 6 months before SWO**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) format before delivery
- [ ] Document MRADL limitations in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- [ ] Comprehensive mobility assessment showing patient cannot safely self-propel
- [ ] **Caregiver assessment showing availability, willingness, and PHYSICAL CAPABILITY to propel heavy duty chair**
- [ ] **Weight documentation >300 lbs** (accurate current weight required)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Submit prior approval request via eMedNY**
- [ ] Face-to-face exam documented
- [ ] Fiscal order format before delivery
- [ ] **Home assessment** - on-site evaluation of home environment for heavy duty chair and caregiver capability
- [ ] Document home AND/OR community mobility needs with caregiver propulsion
- [ ] **Justify transport vs. standard wheelchair** - especially if patient has UE function
- [ ] **Weight >300 lbs documented**

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Weight ≤300 lbs - E1038 appropriate"** - Most common error for E1039. Patient weight documented as ≤300 lbs, making standard transport chair E1038 appropriate (not heavy duty E1039). Fix: Accurately document patient's **current weight >300 lbs**. If patient ≤300 lbs, order E1038 instead. Heavy duty E1039 only covered when weight exceeds 300 lb threshold. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No caregiver physical capability documented"** - Prescription documents caregiver availability and willingness but doesn't address **physical capability** to propel heavy duty chair with bariatric patient. Fix: **Document caregiver's physical ability** to propel heavy duty chair considering: caregiver's own physical condition, strength to push >300 lb patient plus heavy duty chair weight, ability to navigate home/community environments with heavier equipment. Heavy duty chairs require more physical capability than standard chairs. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Patient can self-propel - standard wheelchair appropriate"** - Documentation suggests patient has upper extremity capability to self-propel, making transport chair not medically necessary (standard self-propelled wheelchair would be appropriate). Fix: Clearly document why patient **cannot or should not** self-propel despite obesity: UE paralysis/severe weakness (hemiplegia, quadriplegia), cognitive impairment preventing safe self-propulsion, medical contraindication (cardiac, pulmonary restrictions with exertion), or safety concerns. Justify transport vs. standard wheelchair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No weight documentation"** - Patient weight not documented or documentation unclear if weight >300 lbs threshold. Fix: Document patient's current actual weight in pounds. Weight must clearly exceed 300 lbs to justify heavy duty E1039. Use recent weight measurement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before prior approval received. Fix: Submit and receive Medicaid prior approval before ordering/delivering heavy duty transport chair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Accurately document weight >300 lbs** - current actual weight required, must exceed 300 lb threshold *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document caregiver physical capability** - not just availability/willingness, but physical ability to propel heavy duty chair with bariatric patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify transport vs. standard wheelchair** - explain why self-propulsion not appropriate even if patient has some UE function *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific medical reasons patient cannot safely self-propel (paralysis, weakness, cognitive impairment, contraindication) *(Under Review)*
- F2F exam must assess patient mobility limitations, weight, and caregiver physical capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO before delivery - ensure all required elements included *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Submit prior approval early** - allow time for review before delivery needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment required** - on-site evaluation to verify heavy duty chair can navigate home environment and caregiver can propel in that setting *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document weight >300 lbs** - accurate current weight exceeding 300 lb threshold *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document caregiver physical capability** - heavy duty chair requires more strength/ability to propel than standard chair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify transport vs. standard chair** - explain why caregiver propulsion medically necessary vs. self-propulsion *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Verify home doorways, hallways, and spaces accommodate heavy duty chair dimensions *(Under Review)*
- Fiscal order before delivery with all required documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Weight Documentation Best Practices:**
- Use recent weight (within 3 months) *(Under Review)*
- Document actual weight in pounds, not just "obese" or ">300 lbs" *(Under Review)*
- If weight borderline near 300 lbs, use E1038 (standard) instead *(Under Review)*
- Heavy duty E1039 only justified when weight clearly exceeds 300 lbs *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E1038** - Transport chair, adult, ≤300 lbs (use if patient weight ≤300 lbs)
- **E1037** - Transport chair, pediatric (pediatric version)
- **K0006** - Heavy duty wheelchair, >250 lbs (self-propelled heavy duty alternative)
- **K0007** - Extra heavy duty wheelchair, >300 lbs (self-propelled bariatric alternative)
- **K0001** - Standard wheelchair (self-propelled alternative if patient can self-propel)

**NOTE:** Heavy duty caregiver-propelled transport chair for patients >300 lbs. Caregiver must be documented as available, willing, and PHYSICALLY ABLE to propel heavy duty chair with bariatric patient. Accurate weight documentation >300 lbs required. Must justify transport vs. standard wheelchair if patient has UE function. Prior approval required for Medicaid.
