# A4222 - External Infusion Pump Cassette/Bag Supplies

## Clinical Overview

A4222 is an **infusion supply code** for cassettes or bags used with external drug infusion pumps. This code covers the disposable cassette or bag reservoirs required for cassette-based or bag-based infusion delivery systems. Used for the same serious conditions as A4221: cancer chemotherapy, intractable cancer pain, chronic iron overload, systemic infections, and end-stage heart failure. **Cannot be used with insulin pumps** - insulin pump supplies use different codes (A4224, A4225).

**Key Features:**
- **Per cassette or bag** - billed based on number used
- **Non-insulin drug infusions only** - same pump codes as A4221 (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455)
- **Cannot bill with insulin pump E0784** - critical exclusion
- **No separate PA** - authorization follows pump coverage
- **Must be billed with pump code** - links supply to covered pump

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient on ambulatory chemotherapy infusion pump using cassette system
- Continuous morphine infusion with bag-based delivery
- Deferoxamine chelation using cassette-based pump
- Long-term IV antifungal therapy with disposable bags
- Parenteral inotropic therapy for Stage D heart failure

**Coverage Criteria (same as A4221):**
- Medical necessity for home parenteral administration
- Pump necessary for safe drug delivery
- Prolonged infusion ≥8 hours OR intermittent strict rate control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (when pump covered)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO) required**
- **Face-to-face encounter** documented
- **Same medical necessity documentation as A4221:**
  - Why home parenteral administration necessary
  - Why pump necessary for safe delivery
  - Prolonged infusion ≥8 hours with clinical advantage OR intermittent infusion requiring strictly controlled rate
- **Pump coverage** - must have covered external infusion pump (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455)
- **Drug indication** - must meet covered drug criteria (chemotherapy, morphine, deferoxamine, antifungals/antivirals, inotropics)
- **Billing requirement:** Must be billed WITH specific pump code

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required separately (follows pump authorization)

**Quantity:** Allowance based on number of cassettes/bags used per treatment protocol *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Critical Exclusion:**
- **CANNOT be billed with insulin pump E0784**
- Insulin pump supplies use A4224 (catheter maintenance) and A4225 (syringe cartridge) instead

**Important Notes:**
- Per-cassette or per-bag billing - quantity determined by protocol (e.g., daily bag change = 30 bags/month)
- Must document number of cassettes/bags needed and replacement frequency
- Covered during period of covered pump use

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Practitioner prescription required**
- **Face-to-face encounter** documented
- **Authorization:** DVS or prior approval may be required based on pump type
- **Pump coverage** - must have approved external infusion pump on file

**Quantity:** Allowance based on number of cassettes/bags used per treatment protocol

**NYRx Transition (Important):**
- **As of April 1, 2023:** Part of NYRx benefit transition for certain infusion supplies
- **Billing pathway:** Billing through NYRx (pharmacy) or DMEPOS FFS depending on item and enrollment
- Check current NYRx guidance for specific billing pathway

**Important Notes:**
- Authorization requirement varies by pump type
- DVS authorization may be sufficient for certain pump types
- Contact NY Medicaid for current billing pathway: (800) 342-3005

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "A4222 - Infusion supplies for external drug infusion pump, per cassette or bag"**
- [ ] **Pump code:** Document covered external infusion pump (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455)
  - [ ] **Verify NOT insulin pump E0784** - if insulin pump, use A4225 instead
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (cancer, chronic iron overload, heart failure, systemic infection)
- [ ] **Drug being infused:**
  - [ ] Chemotherapy agent
  - [ ] Morphine for intractable cancer pain
  - [ ] Deferoxamine for chronic iron overload
  - [ ] Antifungal/antiviral
  - [ ] Inotropic agent for Stage D heart failure
- [ ] **Cassette/bag specifications:**
  - [ ] Type of delivery system (cassette-based or bag-based)
  - [ ] Size/volume of cassette or bag
  - [ ] Replacement frequency (e.g., daily, every 3 days, weekly)
  - [ ] Number of cassettes/bags needed per month
- [ ] **Medical necessity for home parenteral administration** (same as A4221)
- [ ] **Pump medical necessity** (prolonged infusion ≥8 hours OR strict rate control)
- [ ] **Face-to-face encounter** documented
- [ ] **Standard Written Order (SWO)** communicated before delivery
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Cannot bill A4222 with insulin pump E0784"** - Code exclusion. Fix: A4222 is for non-insulin drug infusion only. For insulin pump supplies, use A4225 (syringe cartridge) instead. Review pump code on order - if E0784, change supply code to A4225.

2. **"No covered pump on file"** - Supply requires pump coverage. Fix: Ensure patient has approved external infusion pump (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455) with active authorization. Submit pump authorization first, then cassette/bag supply claims.

3. **"Must bill with pump code"** - Missing required pump code. Fix: A4222 claims must include corresponding pump HCPCS code to establish medical necessity. Add pump code to claim (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, or K0455).

4. **"Quantity not justified"** - Excessive cassette/bag quantity. Fix: Document replacement frequency per treatment protocol (e.g., "Cassette changed daily per chemotherapy protocol = 30 cassettes per month" or "Bags changed every 3 days per infection control = 10 bags per month"). Justify quantity based on drug stability, infection control, pump specifications.

5. **"Medical necessity not documented"** - Insufficient justification. Fix: Document same requirements as A4221: why home administration necessary, why pump required (prolonged infusion ≥8 hours OR strict rate control), clinical advantage, patient/caregiver trained. Reference treatment protocol requiring cassette/bag system.

6. **"NYRx transition - bill pharmacy benefit"** (Medicaid) - Item transferred to pharmacy. Fix: As of 4/1/2023, some infusion cassettes/bags moved to NYRx. Check current guidance - may need to bill through pharmacy instead of DME. Contact NY Medicaid for clarification.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- A4222 is **per cassette or bag** - not a bundled weekly allowance like A4221
- Must bill WITH pump code - claims without pump code denied
- **CRITICAL: Cannot use with insulin pump E0784** - insulin supplies use different codes
- Quantity based on replacement protocol - document frequency clearly

**Medicaid:**
- **Check NYRx status** - billing pathway may be through pharmacy (not DME) as of 4/1/2023
- Authorization varies by pump type - confirm before prescribing
- DVS authorization may be sufficient for certain pumps

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Specify cassette vs. bag system (pump-specific requirements)
- Document replacement frequency per protocol (daily, every 3 days, weekly)
- Calculate monthly quantity needed: (30 days ÷ replacement interval = quantity per month)
- Justify quantity based on:
  - Drug stability (e.g., "Drug stable 24 hours only - requires daily cassette change")
  - Infection control (e.g., "Sterile system maintained - bag changed every 3 days per protocol")
  - Pump specifications (e.g., "Pump cassette rated 7-day use per manufacturer")
- Reference treatment protocol or manufacturer specifications supporting replacement schedule

**Cassette vs. Bag Systems:**
- **Cassette-based:** Pre-filled disposable cassettes with integral pump mechanism (common for portable ambulatory pumps)
- **Bag-based:** IV bags connected to pump (common for stationary pumps or larger volume infusions)
- Specify system type on order - determines appropriate supplies

**Pump + Cassette/Bag Relationship:**
- Pump determines cassette/bag type - must be compatible
- Cassette/bag quantity depends on pump specifications and drug protocol
- Coordinate pump and supply orders - supplies follow pump authorization
