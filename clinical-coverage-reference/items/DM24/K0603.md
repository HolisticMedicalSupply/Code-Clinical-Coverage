# K0603 - Replacement Battery - Alkaline 1.5V (Patient-Owned Pump)

## Clinical Overview

K0603 is a **replacement battery** (alkaline 1.5 volt) for patient-owned external infusion pumps. Alkaline batteries are lower cost alternative to silver oxide/lithium but have shorter battery life and less stable voltage. All coverage requirements are **same as K0601/K0602** except battery chemistry.

**Key Features:**
- **Alkaline 1.5 volt battery** - lower cost, shorter life than silver oxide/lithium
- **Patient-owned pumps only** - NOT for rental pumps
- **Same coverage as K0601/K0602**
- **NY Medicaid Fee: $0.57** (significantly lower than silver oxide/lithium)

**Alkaline vs. Silver Oxide/Lithium:**
- **Alkaline (K0603):** Lower cost, shorter battery life, voltage drops over discharge
- **Silver oxide (K0601):** Higher cost, longer life, stable voltage
- **Lithium (A4602, K0604, K0605):** Highest cost, longest life, most stable voltage

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601/K0602**
- Patient ownership documented
- Face-to-face encounter
- Written order
- Proof of delivery required
- Battery medically necessary component of covered pump therapy
- Billing per CMS HCPCS guidelines

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** NOT separately payable ✗

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Fee Schedule Rate:** $0.57 (lower cost reflects alkaline's lower price)

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601/K0602**
- Fiscal order
- Patient ownership documented
- DVS authorization may be required
- **Providers must confirm recipient eligibility on service date**

**CRITICAL - Facility Exclusion:**
- **NOT covered when cost included in facility Medicaid rate**
- Home/community setting: Billable ✓
- Facility with all-inclusive rate: NOT separately billable ✗

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** NOT separately billable ✗

## Prescription Checklist

**SAME AS K0601/K0602** - see K0601 for detailed checklist

**Key differences:**
- [ ] Battery specification: **Alkaline 1.5 volt**
- [ ] Verify pump accepts alkaline batteries (some pumps require silver oxide/lithium only)
- [ ] For Medicaid: Confirm patient not in facility with all-inclusive Medicaid rate
- [ ] For Medicaid: Verify recipient eligibility on service date

## Common Denial Reasons

**SAME AS K0601/K0602** plus:

**Additional Medicaid denials:**
1. **"Cost included in facility Medicaid rate"** - Patient in facility. Fix: K0603 not separately billable when patient in facility with all-inclusive Medicaid rate. Verify patient location - only bill for home/community patients, not facility residents.

2. **"Recipient not eligible on service date"** - Eligibility lapsed. Fix: Verify Medicaid eligibility on date of service before billing. If eligibility lapsed, patient responsible or must reestablish eligibility before battery provided.

3. **"Pump requires silver oxide/lithium battery"** - Wrong battery type. Fix: Some precision pumps require silver oxide or lithium for stable voltage. Verify manufacturer specifications - if pump requires silver oxide/lithium, use K0601 (silver oxide 1.5V) or A4602 (lithium 1.5V) instead of alkaline.

## Tips for Prescribers

**SAME AS K0601/K0602** except:

**Battery Chemistry Selection:**
- **Use Alkaline (K0603) when:**
  - Pump accepts alkaline batteries
  - Cost is priority over longevity
  - Patient can tolerate more frequent battery changes
  - Pump has low precision requirements
- **Use Silver Oxide (K0601) when:**
  - Longer battery life needed
  - Stable voltage critical for pump function
  - Patient prefers less frequent changes
  - Pump manufacturer recommends silver oxide
- **Use Lithium (A4602, K0604, K0605) when:**
  - Longest battery life needed
  - Most stable voltage required
  - Pump operates in extreme temperatures
  - Pump manufacturer specifies lithium

**Alkaline Battery Characteristics:**
- **Lower cost:** $0.57 Medicaid fee vs. $6.67 silver oxide
- **Shorter life:** Typically 30-50% shorter than silver oxide/lithium
- **Voltage drop:** Voltage decreases over discharge (may affect pump accuracy near end of battery life)
- **More frequent replacement:** Patient must change batteries more often

**NY Medicaid Specific:**
- Fee: $0.57 (reflects alkaline's lower cost)
- Verify patient location - NOT billable in facility with all-inclusive rate
- Confirm eligibility on service date before providing battery
- 6-year record retention

**All other requirements same as K0601/K0602** - see K0601 for comprehensive guidance.
