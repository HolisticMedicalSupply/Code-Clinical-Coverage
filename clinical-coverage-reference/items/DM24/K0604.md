# K0604 - Replacement Battery - Lithium 3.6V (Patient-Owned Pump)

## Clinical Overview

K0604 is a **replacement battery** (lithium 3.6 volt) for patient-owned external infusion pumps. Lithium 3.6V batteries provide high capacity and stable voltage, commonly used in insulin pumps and other continuous-operation ambulatory devices. All coverage requirements are **same as K0601-K0603** except battery specifications.

**Key Features:**
- **Lithium 3.6 volt battery** - high capacity, stable voltage, long life
- **Patient-owned pumps only** - NOT for rental pumps
- **Commonly used in insulin pumps (E0784)** - higher voltage/capacity than 1.5V batteries
- **Same coverage as K0601-K0603**
- **NY Medicaid Fee: $6.38**

**Lithium Battery Advantages:**
- Longest battery life (compared to alkaline/silver oxide)
- Most stable voltage over discharge curve
- Performs well in temperature extremes
- Lightweight
- Low self-discharge rate

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601-K0603**
- Patient ownership documented
- Face-to-face encounter required **per Final Rule 1713**
- Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) required **per Final Rule 1713**
- Claims without proper documentation denied as not reasonable and necessary
- Must bill with appropriate pump HCPCS code

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** NOT separately payable ✗

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Fee Schedule Rate:** $6.38

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601-K0603**
- Fiscal order
- Patient ownership documented
- DVS authorization may be required
- **Prior approval required if exceeds frequency limits**

**Medicare/Medicaid Crossover (Dual-Eligible Patients):**
- Bill Medicare first
- Submit Medicare EOB (Explanation of Benefits) with Medicaid claim
- Medicaid pays remaining cost-sharing

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** NOT separately billable ✗

## Prescription Checklist

**SAME AS K0601-K0603** - see K0601 for detailed checklist

**Key differences:**
- [ ] Battery specification: **Lithium 3.6 volt** (higher voltage than 1.5V)
- [ ] Verify pump requires 3.6V lithium battery per manufacturer specifications
- [ ] Common for insulin pumps (E0784) - verify pump model battery requirements
- [ ] For Medicaid: If replacement more frequent than typical, document justification for PA

## Common Denial Reasons

**SAME AS K0601-K0603** plus:

**Additional denials:**
1. **"No documentation per Final Rule 1713"** (Medicare) - Missing required documentation. Fix: CMS Final Rule 1713 requires face-to-face encounter and WOPD for DME. Ensure both documented: (1) Face-to-face encounter for pump therapy within required timeframe, (2) WOPD communicated to supplier before delivery. Claims denied without both elements.

2. **"Frequency limit exceeded - prior approval required"** (Medicaid) - Replaced too frequently. Fix: If battery replacement more frequent than established limits, submit prior approval request. Document: premature battery failure, increased pump use, high-drain pump model, manufacturer battery life specifications, justification for accelerated replacement.

3. **"Wrong battery voltage"** - Incorrect battery ordered. Fix: K0604 is 3.6 VOLT (not 1.5V or 4.5V). Verify pump manufacturer specifications - does pump require 3.6V lithium battery? Other voltages use different codes. Order correct voltage per pump specs.

4. **"Medicare EOB not submitted"** (Medicaid for dual-eligible) - Crossover billing error. Fix: For Medicare/Medicaid dual-eligible patients, must bill Medicare first. After Medicare processes claim, submit Medicare EOB with Medicaid claim. Medicaid cannot process without Medicare EOB showing primary payment.

## Tips for Prescribers

**SAME AS K0601-K0603** except:

**Battery Voltage Verification:**
- **K0604 is 3.6 VOLT** (higher than 1.5V, lower than 4.5V)
- Commonly used in insulin pumps (E0784) - many insulin pump models use 3.6V lithium
- Verify pump manufacturer specifications for required voltage
- Other battery voltages:
  - **1.5V:** K0601 (silver oxide), A4602 (lithium), K0603 (alkaline)
  - **3V:** K0602 (silver oxide)
  - **3.6V:** K0604 (lithium) ← This code
  - **4.5V:** K0605 (lithium)

**Lithium Battery Characteristics:**
- **Longest battery life:** Typically 2-3x longer than alkaline
- **Stable voltage:** Maintains consistent voltage throughout discharge
- **Temperature tolerance:** Performs well in heat/cold
- **Higher initial cost:** But longer life = better value
- **Low self-discharge:** Can store long periods without losing charge

**Common Use - Insulin Pumps:**
- Many insulin pump models use 3.6V lithium batteries
- Examples: Some Medtronic, Tandem, Omnipod models
- Verify specific pump model battery requirements
- Document pump model and manufacturer battery specifications

**NY Medicaid Specific:**
- Fee: $6.38 (reflects lithium's higher cost vs. alkaline $0.57)
- PA required if exceeding frequency limits - document justification
- Dual-eligible patients: Bill Medicare first, then Medicaid with EOB

**Final Rule 1713 Compliance (Medicare):**
- Face-to-face encounter documented
- WOPD communicated before delivery
- Both required per CMS Final Rule 1713
- Non-compliance results in denial as "not reasonable and necessary"

**All other requirements same as K0601-K0603** - see K0601 for comprehensive guidance.
