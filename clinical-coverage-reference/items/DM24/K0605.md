# K0605 - Replacement Battery - Lithium 4.5V (Patient-Owned Pump)

## Clinical Overview

K0605 is a **replacement battery** (lithium 4.5 volt) for patient-owned external infusion pumps. This is the **highest voltage battery** available, providing maximum capacity for sophisticated ambulatory pumps with multiple functions or continuous high-demand therapy. All coverage requirements are **same as K0601-K0604** except battery specifications.

**Key Features:**
- **Lithium 4.5 volt battery** - HIGHEST voltage option, maximum capacity
- **Patient-owned pumps only** - NOT for rental pumps
- **For complex/high-power pumps** - sophisticated ambulatory pumps with extended battery requirements
- **Same coverage as K0601-K0604**

**When K0605 Used:**
- Sophisticated multi-function pumps requiring high power
- Continuous high-demand therapy delivery (high infusion rates, multiple channels)
- Pumps with advanced features (displays, alarms, data logging)
- Extended battery life requirements (minimize changes)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601-K0604**
- Patient ownership documented
- Face-to-face encounter
- **Standard written order must be communicated BEFORE claim submission**
- **Claims submitted before delivery DENIED**
- **Refills require documented beneficiary contact within 30 days**

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** NOT separately payable ✗

**CRITICAL - Order Timing:**
- Order BEFORE claim submission (not after)
- Delivery BEFORE claim submission
- Claims submitted before delivery = automatic denial

**CRITICAL - Refill Contact:**
- Refills require documented patient contact within 30 days
- Anti-fraud measure - verify patient still needs/uses battery
- Document date and method of contact (phone, visit, etc.)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601-K0604**
- Fiscal order
- Patient ownership documented
- DVS authorization may be required
- **6-year record retention requirement**

**Record-Keeping Requirements:**
- Signed practitioner order (fiscal order)
- Delivery receipt
- Acquisition invoices
- **Maintained 6 years**

**Free Choice of Provider:**
- Medicaid beneficiary has right to choose DME supplier
- Cannot restrict beneficiary to specific provider

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** NOT separately billable ✗

## Prescription Checklist

**SAME AS K0601-K0604** - see K0601 for detailed checklist

**Key differences:**
- [ ] Battery specification: **Lithium 4.5 volt** (HIGHEST voltage available)
- [ ] Verify pump requires 4.5V lithium battery per manufacturer specifications
- [ ] Document pump is sophisticated/high-demand model requiring 4.5V
- [ ] **For Medicare: Ensure order communicated BEFORE claim submission**
- [ ] **For Medicare refills: Document beneficiary contact within 30 days**
- [ ] **For Medicaid: Establish 6-year record retention system**

## Common Denial Reasons

**SAME AS K0601-K0604** plus:

**Additional Medicare denials:**
1. **"Claim submitted before delivery"** - Timing violation. Fix: Medicare specifically prohibits claims submitted before delivery for K0605. MUST deliver battery to patient BEFORE submitting claim. Document delivery date. Submit claim after delivery date (not before or same day).

2. **"No documented beneficiary contact for refill"** - Refill requirement. Fix: Refills require documented patient contact within 30 days. Document: (1) Date of contact, (2) Method (phone, visit, email), (3) Patient confirmation still using pump/needs battery, (4) Patient signature or verbal confirmation recorded. Without documented contact, refill claim denied as potential fraud.

3. **"Standard written order not on file"** - Missing order. Fix: Standard written order must be communicated to supplier BEFORE claim submission. Ensure order on file documenting: pump code, battery specifications (lithium 4.5V), quantity, medical necessity. Coordinate with supplier before ordering.

**Additional Medicaid denials:**
4. **"Records not maintained 6 years"** - Record retention violation. Fix: NY Medicaid requires 6-year retention of: fiscal order (signed by practitioner), delivery receipt, acquisition invoices. Establish record-keeping system maintaining all documents 6 years. Audits can request records back to 6 years.

5. **"Wrong battery voltage - pump requires lower voltage"** - Incorrect battery ordered. Fix: K0605 is 4.5 VOLT (highest voltage). Most pumps use lower voltages (1.5V, 3V, 3.6V). Verify manufacturer specifications - only order K0605 if pump specifically requires 4.5V lithium. Using higher voltage than specified can damage pump.

## Tips for Prescribers

**SAME AS K0601-K0604** except:

**Battery Voltage Verification - CRITICAL:**
- **K0605 is 4.5 VOLT** - HIGHEST voltage available
- **Most pumps do NOT require 4.5V** - verify carefully before ordering
- Only sophisticated/high-power pumps typically use 4.5V
- Using wrong voltage can damage pump
- Battery voltage options:
  - **1.5V:** K0601 (silver oxide), A4602 (lithium), K0603 (alkaline) ← Most common
  - **3V:** K0602 (silver oxide)
  - **3.6V:** K0604 (lithium) ← Common for insulin pumps
  - **4.5V:** K0605 (lithium) ← Least common, highest voltage

**When to Order K0605 (4.5V):**
- Pump manufacturer specifications explicitly require 4.5V lithium
- Sophisticated multi-channel pump with high power requirements
- Ambulatory pump with advanced display/data logging features
- Continuous high-demand infusion therapy
- Extended battery life needed (4.5V provides longest life)

**When NOT to Order K0605:**
- Pump uses 1.5V, 3V, or 3.6V battery (use appropriate lower-voltage code)
- Standard insulin pump (typically uses 3.6V - use K0604)
- Simple single-channel pump (typically uses 1.5V)
- Pump voltage unknown - DO NOT guess, verify with manufacturer

**Medicare Order Timing Requirements:**
- **Order → Delivery → Claim** (correct sequence)
- NOT: Order → Claim → Delivery (claim will be denied)
- NOT: Claim → Order → Delivery (claim will be denied)
- Document delivery date clearly
- Submit claim AFTER confirmed delivery

**Medicare Refill Contact Documentation:**
- Contact patient within 30 days of refill order
- Document:
  - "Contacted patient [date] via [phone/visit]"
  - "Patient confirmed continued pump use and battery need"
  - "Patient signature [if in-person] or verbal confirmation documented"
- Without contact documentation, refill denied

**NY Medicaid Record Retention:**
- **6-year retention requirement** - establish system early
- Required documents:
  - Fiscal order with prescriber signature
  - Delivery receipt (patient signature, date)
  - Acquisition invoices (supplier purchase documentation)
- Organize by patient and date for easy audit retrieval
- Audits can request records up to 6 years back

**All other requirements same as K0601-K0604** - see K0601 for comprehensive guidance.
