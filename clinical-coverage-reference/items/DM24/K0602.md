# K0602 - Replacement Battery - Silver Oxide 3V (Patient-Owned Pump)

## Clinical Overview

K0602 is a **replacement battery** (silver oxide 3 volt) for patient-owned external infusion pumps. This higher-voltage silver oxide battery (3V vs. 1.5V) is used in pumps requiring greater power output. All coverage requirements are **same as K0601** except battery voltage specification.

**Key Features:**
- **Silver oxide 3 volt battery** - higher voltage than K0601 (1.5V)
- **Patient-owned pumps only** - NOT for rental pumps
- **Same coverage as K0601** - same indications, documentation, requirements
- **Face-to-face and WOPD required**
- **NY Medicaid Fee: $6.67**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601**
- Patient ownership documented
- Face-to-face encounter
- Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD)
- Standard written order
- Documentation per LCD A55426
- KX modifier when coverage criteria met

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** NOT separately payable ✗

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes (for patient-owned pumps only)

**Fee Schedule Rate:** $6.67

**Requirements:** **SAME AS K0601**
- Fiscal order with prescriber signature
- Delivery statement
- Medical necessity documentation (maintained 6 years)
- DVS authorization may be required
- Patient ownership documented

**CRITICAL - Rental vs. Owned:**
- **Patient-owned:** Billable ✓
- **Rented:** Included in rental, NOT separately billable ✗

## Prescription Checklist

**Same as K0601** - see K0601 for detailed checklist

**Key difference:**
- [ ] Battery specification: **Silver oxide 3 volt** (not 1.5V)
- [ ] Verify pump requires 3V battery per manufacturer specifications

## Common Denial Reasons

**SAME AS K0601** - see K0601 for detailed denial reasons and fixes

Most common:
1. Pump is rented - batteries not separately payable
2. No proof of patient ownership
3. No WOPD or face-to-face documented
4. Wrong battery voltage ordered (verify pump requires 3V, not 1.5V)

## Tips for Prescribers

**SAME AS K0601** except:

**Battery Voltage Verification:**
- **K0602 is 3 VOLT** (higher voltage than K0601's 1.5V)
- Verify pump manufacturer specifications - does pump require 3V battery?
- Other battery voltages use different codes:
  - **K0601** - Silver oxide 1.5V
  - **A4602** - Lithium 1.5V
  - **K0603** - Alkaline 1.5V
  - **K0604** - Lithium 3.6V
  - **K0605** - Lithium 4.5V
- Order correct voltage per pump specifications

**NY Medicaid Specific:**
- Fee Schedule rate: $6.67
- Documentation maintained 6 years (record retention requirement)
- Fiscal order must include prescriber signature

**All other requirements same as K0601** - see K0601 for comprehensive documentation guidance.
