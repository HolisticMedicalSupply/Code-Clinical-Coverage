# K0601 - Replacement Battery - Silver Oxide 1.5V (Patient-Owned Pump)

## Clinical Overview

K0601 is a **replacement battery** (silver oxide 1.5 volt) for patient-owned external infusion pumps. Silver oxide batteries provide stable voltage and longer life than alkaline batteries, commonly used in precision medical devices requiring consistent power delivery. **Only applies to patient-owned pumps** - batteries for rented pumps are included in the monthly rental fee.

**Key Features:**
- **Silver oxide 1.5 volt battery** - stable voltage, longer life than alkaline
- **Patient-owned pumps only** - NOT for rental pumps
- **Wide indication coverage** - diabetes, cancer, iron overload, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, immunodeficiency, Parkinson's, other FDA-approved therapies
- **Face-to-face and WOPD required** - standard DME documentation
- **No PA if criteria met** (Medicare) - follows pump authorization

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient owns insulin pump requiring silver oxide battery
- Patient owns ambulatory chemotherapy pump
- Patient owns morphine pain management pump
- Patient owns epoprostenol pump for pulmonary hypertension
- Patient owns SCIg pump for immunodeficiency
- Battery depleted, needs replacement for continued pump operation

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Patient must OWN the pump (not renting)
- Pump must be covered/authorized for FDA-approved indication

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Supply code: "K0601 - Replacement battery, external infusion pump, silver oxide, 1.5 volt, each"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (diabetes, cancer, iron overload, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, immunodeficiency, Parkinson's)
- [ ] **Pump information:**
  - [ ] Pump HCPCS code (E0779-E0781, E0784, E0791, K0455)
  - [ ] Pump serial number
  - [ ] Pump manufacturer and model
  - [ ] Battery type required: silver oxide 1.5V
- [ ] **Patient ownership documentation:**
  - [ ] Proof of purchase (receipt, invoice, prior purchase claim)
  - [ ] Date pump purchased
  - [ ] Patient owns pump (not renting) - clearly state
- [ ] **Battery specifications:**
  - [ ] Number of batteries needed per replacement cycle
  - [ ] Expected battery life (manufacturer specifications)
  - [ ] Replacement frequency justified
- [ ] **Medical necessity:**
  - [ ] Pump medically necessary for covered indication
  - [ ] Battery required for continued pump operation
  - [ ] Alternative therapy not appropriate

- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Pump is rented - batteries not separately payable"** - Most common denial. Fix: K0601 only covered for patient-OWNED pumps. If pump is rented, batteries included in monthly rental and CANNOT be billed separately. Verify ownership - if rental, do not submit battery claims. If owned, document ownership clearly (purchase receipt, capped rental completion, ownership affidavit).

2. **"No proof of patient ownership"** - Missing ownership documentation. Fix: Submit proof: purchase receipt, prior purchase claim, serial number documentation, capped rental completion (13+ rental months = ownership transfer). Must demonstrate patient owns pump.

3. **"No face-to-face encounter documented"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: Document face-to-face encounter for pump therapy within appropriate timeframe. Include: pump assessment, battery needs discussion, continued medical necessity evaluation. Date and provider must be documented.

4. **"No Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) on file"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: WOPD must be communicated to supplier BEFORE delivery. Include: pump code, battery specifications (silver oxide 1.5V), quantity, medical necessity. Coordinate with supplier to ensure WOPD on file.

5. **"Documentation requirements per LCD A55426 not met"** - Insufficient documentation. Fix: Meet LCD A55426 requirements: face-to-face encounter, WOPD, standard written order, pump covered for appropriate indication, medical necessity established. Review LCD and ensure all elements documented.

6. **"No covered pump on file"** - Pump authorization not established. Fix: Patient must have covered infusion pump authorization. Submit pump authorization first (if not established), then battery claims. Battery coverage follows pump authorization.

7. **"KX modifier not included"** - Missing required modifier. Fix: KX modifier may be required per LCD to indicate coverage criteria met. Add KX modifier to claim.

8. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Missing authorization. Fix: NY Medicaid may require DVS authorization for batteries depending on pump type. Check DVS requirements - submit authorization request if needed. Contact NY Medicaid for guidance.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **CRITICAL: Patient-owned pumps only** - verify ownership FIRST
- Rental pumps: batteries included, cannot bill K0601
- WOPD and face-to-face required - plan ahead
- KX modifier may be required per LCD
- No separate PA if documentation meets LCD criteria

**Medicaid:**
- **Same ownership requirement** - patient-owned only
- DVS authorization may be required based on pump type
- Listed in DME Fee Schedule
- Fiscal order required

**Documentation Best Practices:**

**Verify Pump Ownership:**
- Review pump authorization history - capped rental purchase or direct purchase?
- Capped rental: 13 months rental = ownership transfer
- Direct purchase: patient paid upfront for pump
- Request patient documentation: purchase receipt, ownership papers
- Contact supplier: verify ownership status in records

**Battery Specifications:**
- Verify pump requires silver oxide 1.5V battery (consult manufacturer specifications)
- Other battery chemistries use different codes:
  - **A4602** - Lithium 1.5V
  - **K0603** - Alkaline 1.5V
  - **K0602** - Silver oxide 3V
  - **K0604** - Lithium 3.6V
  - **K0605** - Lithium 4.5V
- Order correct battery chemistry per pump specs

**Medical Necessity Documentation:**
- Document pump covered for appropriate indication (diabetes, cancer, etc.)
- Establish battery medically necessary for continued therapy
- Example: "Patient requires continuous insulin infusion via pump for Type 1 diabetes management - battery depletion would interrupt medically necessary therapy"

**Quantity Justification:**
- Document number of batteries needed based on:
  - Pump specifications (single or multiple battery)
  - Expected battery life (manufacturer data)
  - Replacement frequency
- Example: "Pump requires one silver oxide 1.5V battery. Manufacturer specifies 6-month battery life. Requesting one battery for 6-month replacement cycle."

**Face-to-Face Encounter:**
- Document encounter related to pump therapy
- Include: pump function assessment, battery status evaluation, continued therapy medical necessity
- Within appropriate timeframe per Medicare requirements

**Rental vs. Owned Examples:**
- **Owned (Can bill K0601):**
  - Patient purchased pump outright 2 years ago ✓
  - Patient completed 13-month capped rental (now owns pump) ✓
  - Patient inherited pump from estate, now registered owner ✓
- **Rental (Cannot bill K0601):**
  - Patient on month 5 of capped rental ✗
  - Patient on indefinite monthly rental ✗
  - Patient borrowing pump temporarily ✗
