# A4244 - Antiseptic Solution for Catheter Care (Alcohol or Peroxide)

## Clinical Overview

A4244 is an **antiseptic solution** (alcohol or peroxide) used for catheter site care with external infusion pumps. This is a general medical supply for skin preparation and catheter maintenance, used for infection control as part of catheter care protocols. Applies to both non-insulin drug infusion catheters and insulin infusion pump catheter sites.

**Note:** This code is listed under both **DM24 (External Infusion Pump Supplies)** and **DM25 (Insulin Infusion Pump Supplies)** - it covers antiseptic for all infusion catheter types.

**Key Features:**
- **Per pint** - billed based on quantity used
- **Alcohol or peroxide** - antiseptic solution for catheter site care
- **General medical supply** - used for various catheter types (IV, PICC, central line, subcutaneous, epidural)
- **No separate PA for Medicare** - covered when used with pump therapy
- **Medicaid direct bill** - no PA unless exceeding quantity limit

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Daily catheter site cleaning for home chemotherapy infusion (PICC or central line)
- Insulin pump catheter site preparation before insertion (every 2-3 days)
- Epidural catheter site care for morphine pain management
- Subcutaneous catheter maintenance for deferoxamine infusion
- Peripheral IV site care for antibiotic infusion

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Medicare: Medical necessity for infusion therapy requiring pump/catheter
- Medicaid: Up to 5 pints per 30 days (PA required if exceeding limit)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (when used with covered infusion pump)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** for infusion therapy
- **Medical necessity** for infusion therapy requiring pump/catheter documented
- **Face-to-face encounter** for pump therapy documented
- **Infection control protocol** - catheter site care with antiseptic per standard of care

**Prior Authorization:** NOT separately required (coverage follows pump authorization)

**Frequency:** No specific frequency limits; based on medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** Based on medical necessity per catheter maintenance protocol *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Covered as part of catheter maintenance supplies when patient on pump therapy
- No standalone PA needed - follows infusion pump coverage
- Quantity determined by catheter care protocol (e.g., daily site cleaning, catheter change frequency)
- Must be used for catheter site antisepsis/infection control

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes - Direct bill

**Requirements:**
- **Practitioner order** required
- **No diagnosis-specific restrictions** - general medical supply
- **Quantity limit: Up to 5 pints per 30 days maximum**
- **Exceeding quantity limit requires prior approval**

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (unless exceeding 5 pints/30 days)

**Frequency:** Based on catheter care needs, within quantity limit

**Important Notes:**
- Listed under Medical Supplies as antiseptic for general medical use
- Used for skin preparation and catheter site care (all catheter types)
- Direct bill - simpler process than PA
- 5 pint monthly maximum typical threshold
- If patient needs >5 pints/month, submit PA with justification

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Supply code: "A4244 - Alcohol or peroxide, per pint"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code:
  - [ ] Underlying condition requiring infusion therapy (cancer, diabetes, iron overload, infection, heart failure) OR
  - [ ] General catheter care code (Z76.2, Z48.02)
- [ ] **Catheter type and indication:**
  - [ ] Peripheral IV, PICC, central line (for chemotherapy, antibiotics, pain medication)
  - [ ] Subcutaneous catheter (for insulin, deferoxamine, SCIg)
  - [ ] Epidural catheter (for pain management)
- [ ] **Quantity needed:**
  - [ ] Calculate based on catheter care protocol
  - [ ] For Medicaid: Justify if exceeding 5 pints per 30 days
- [ ] **Catheter care protocol:**
  - [ ] Frequency of catheter site cleaning (daily, before each catheter change, etc.)
  - [ ] Volume of antiseptic per cleaning
  - [ ] Infection control standards followed
- [ ] **For Medicare: Pump therapy documentation** (SWO, face-to-face, medical necessity)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No covered infusion pump on file"** (Medicare) - Supply requires pump therapy. Fix: Ensure patient has covered external infusion pump (E0779-E0781, E0791, K0455) or insulin pump (E0784) with active authorization. A4244 follows pump coverage.

2. **"Medical necessity not documented"** (Medicare) - Insufficient justification. Fix: Document catheter type, infusion therapy indication, catheter site care protocol per infection control standards. Explain why antiseptic solution medically necessary (catheter-related bloodstream infection prevention, standard of care).

3. **"Quantity exceeds limit - prior approval required"** (Medicaid) - Exceeded 5 pints/30 days. Fix: For quantities >5 pints/month, submit prior approval request. Justify based on: multiple catheters, frequent catheter changes (e.g., insulin pump every 2-3 days), large catheter site area, infection control protocol requiring extensive site prep.

4. **"Quantity not justified"** - Excessive quantity without explanation. Fix: Calculate and document quantity needed:
   - Volume per site cleaning (e.g., 5-10 mL per cleaning)
   - Frequency of site cleaning (e.g., daily = 30 cleanings/month)
   - Monthly usage: (volume per cleaning × frequency = total volume)
   - Convert to pints (1 pint = ~473 mL)
   - Example: 10 mL/day × 30 days = 300 mL/month = 0.63 pints/month

5. **"No practitioner order on file"** (Medicaid) - Missing required order. Fix: Submit practitioner order specifying A4244, quantity per month, medical necessity (catheter site care), catheter type/indication.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- A4244 follows infusion pump authorization - ensure pump coverage active
- No separate PA needed - covered as catheter maintenance supply
- Quantity based on catheter care protocol - no specific Medicare limit documented

**Medicaid:**
- **Direct bill** - no PA required for quantities ≤5 pints/30 days
- **5 pint monthly limit** - typical maximum without PA
- If patient needs >5 pints/month, submit PA with detailed justification
- No diagnosis restrictions - general medical supply

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Specify catheter type (PICC, central line, subcutaneous, epidural, peripheral IV)
- Document catheter care protocol:
  - Site cleaning frequency (daily, before each change, etc.)
  - Volume of antiseptic per cleaning
  - Infection control standards (CDC guidelines, institutional protocol)
- Calculate monthly quantity needed based on protocol
- For high quantities, justify based on:
  - Multiple catheters
  - Frequent catheter changes (insulin pump every 2-3 days = 10-15 site preps/month)
  - Large catheter site area requiring more antiseptic
  - Infection risk factors (immunocompromised, history of line infections)

**Quantity Calculation Examples:**

**Example 1: Insulin Pump**
- Catheter changed every 3 days
- Site cleaned before each catheter change
- ~10 mL antiseptic per site prep
- 30 days ÷ 3 days = 10 catheter changes/month
- 10 changes × 10 mL = 100 mL/month = 0.21 pints/month ✓ (within Medicaid limit)

**Example 2: PICC Line for Chemotherapy**
- Site cleaned daily
- ~5 mL antiseptic per cleaning
- 30 cleanings/month × 5 mL = 150 mL/month = 0.32 pints/month ✓ (within limit)

**Example 3: Multiple Catheters (Insulin Pump + PICC Line)**
- Insulin pump: 0.21 pints/month
- PICC line: 0.32 pints/month
- Total: 0.53 pints/month ✓ (within limit)

**Example Exceeding Limit:**
- Patient with 3 different infusion catheters
- Very frequent catheter changes
- Large site area requiring 50 mL per prep
- Total: 6 pints/month → **Requires Medicaid PA** with detailed justification

**Alcohol vs. Peroxide:**
- **Alcohol (70% isopropyl):** Most common antiseptic for catheter site care, rapid action, broad spectrum
- **Peroxide (hydrogen peroxide 3%):** Alternative antiseptic, useful for wound cleansing, less common for routine site care
- Either acceptable per A4244 - specify which solution on order
