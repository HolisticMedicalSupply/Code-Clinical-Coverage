# A4226 - Insulin Pump Supplies with Therapeutic CGM Integration (RETIRED CODE)

## ðŸš¨ CODE RETIRED SEPTEMBER 15, 2020 - NOT VALID FOR BILLING

## Important Notice

**A4226 IS A RETIRED CODE.** This code was discontinued on **September 15, 2020** and is **no longer valid for billing** to Medicare or Medicaid.

**Claims submitted with A4226 will be DENIED as invalid code.**

### Historical Use

A4226 was historically used for supplies related to insulin infusion pumps with dosage rate adjustment using therapeutic CGM (continuous glucose monitoring). This applied to integrated pump-CGM systems with automated dosage adjustment algorithms.

### Current Billing (As of 2025)

**For Insulin Pump Supplies:**
- **A4224** - Supplies for maintenance of insulin infusion catheter, per week
- **A4225** - Supplies for external insulin infusion pump, syringe type cartridge, sterile, each

**For CGM Supplies (billed separately):**
- **A9276** - Sensor; invasive (e.g., subcutaneous), disposable, for use with interstitial continuous glucose monitoring system, one unit = 1 day supply
- **A9277** - Transmitter; external, for use with interstitial continuous glucose monitoring system
- **A9278** - Receiver (monitor); external, for use with interstitial continuous glucose monitoring system

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

**NOT COVERED** - Code discontinued September 15, 2020

**Action Required:**
- **Use A4224 or A4225** for insulin pump supplies
- **Use separate CGM codes** (A9276, A9277, A9278) for CGM supplies
- Claims with A4226 will be **denied as invalid code**

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**NOT COVERED** - Code retired, not listed in current DME manual

**Action Required:**
- **Use A4224** for insulin pump catheter maintenance supplies
- **Use separate CGM codes** for CGM supplies
- Code no longer appears in NY Medicaid DME manual

## Important Information for Prescribers

### Why Was This Code Retired?

The retirement of A4226 likely reflects changes in coverage policy for integrated insulin pump-CGM systems:
1. **Separation of benefits:** Insulin pump supplies and CGM supplies are now billed separately rather than as integrated bundle
2. **Payment policy changes:** Different coverage pathways for pump vs. CGM components
3. **Technology evolution:** Newer hybrid closed-loop systems (automated insulin delivery) may have different coverage frameworks

### How to Bill for Integrated Pump-CGM Systems (2025)

**For patients using integrated insulin pump-CGM systems (e.g., Medtronic 670G/770G, Tandem Control-IQ, Omnipod 5):**

**Pump Supplies:**
- Use **A4224** (weekly catheter maintenance supplies)
- Use **A4225** (syringe cartridges/reservoirs)

**CGM Supplies:**
- Use **A9276** (CGM sensors)
- Use **A9277** (CGM transmitter)
- Use **A9278** (CGM receiver if applicable)

**Bill separately** - do NOT attempt to bundle or use A4226

### Documentation Requirements

See A4224 and A4225 documentation requirements for insulin pump supplies.

See CGM-specific codes (A9276, A9277, A9278) for CGM supply documentation.
