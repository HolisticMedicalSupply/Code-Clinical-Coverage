# K0552 - Syringe Type Cartridge for External Non-Insulin Pump

## Clinical Overview

K0552 is a **syringe-type cartridge/reservoir** for external drug infusion pumps. This sterile disposable syringe cartridge is used with syringe-based ambulatory infusion pumps for serious conditions requiring continuous or strictly controlled-rate drug delivery. **NOT for insulin pumps** - insulin pump syringe cartridges use code A4225 instead.

**IMPORTANT: KX Modifier Required** - As of March 1, 2023, Medicare requires KX modifier on all K0552 claims to indicate coverage criteria met.

**Key Features:**
- **Syringe-type cartridge** - disposable sterile reservoir for syringe pumps
- **Non-insulin drugs only** - for external drug pumps (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455)
- **NOT for insulin pumps E0784** - critical exclusion
- **KX modifier required** - mandatory as of 3/1/2023 for Medicare
- **Per cartridge billing** - billed per syringe/cartridge used
- **Maximize concentration** - utilization management requirement

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Ambulatory chemotherapy using portable syringe pump
- Continuous morphine infusion for cancer pain (syringe-based pump)
- Deferoxamine chelation via syringe pump (8-12 hours daily)
- Epoprostenol/treprostinil for pulmonary hypertension (continuous IV)
- SCIg (subcutaneous immune globulin) via syringe pump for immunodeficiency
- Dobutamine/milrinone for Stage D heart failure via portable syringe pump

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Medical necessity for home parenteral drug administration
- Pump necessary for safe delivery (prolonged ≥8 hours OR strict rate control)
- Drug meets covered indication criteria
- Quantity justified based on protocol - concentration maximized to minimize syringes

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"KX modifier not billed"** (Medicare - MOST COMMON as of 3/1/2023) - Missing required modifier. Fix: As of March 1, 2023, KX modifier is MANDATORY on all K0552 Medicare claims. Add KX modifier to indicate coverage criteria met (home parenteral drug administration medically necessary, pump required for safe delivery, drug meets criteria). Claims without KX modifier will be automatically denied.

2. **"Cannot bill K0552 with insulin pump E0784"** - Wrong supply code. Fix: K0552 is for NON-INSULIN drug pumps only. For insulin pump syringe cartridges, use A4225 instead. Review pump code - if E0784 (insulin pump), change supply code to A4225. K0552 only for E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455.

3. **"Quantity not justified - concentration not maximized"** - Utilization management denial. Fix: Medicare requires maximizing drug concentration to minimize number of syringes/cartridges. Document: (1) Current drug concentration used, (2) Maximum concentration per pharmacy stability guidelines, (3) If not using max concentration, explain why (viscosity, compatibility, patient tolerance, protocol requirements). Example: "Using morphine 50 mg/mL (maximum stable concentration per USP guidelines) to minimize syringe changes."

4. **"No Standard Written Order (SWO) on file"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: SWO must be communicated to supplier BEFORE delivery. Include: pump code, drug name, syringe specifications, diagnosis, treatment duration, quantity per month. Coordinate with supplier to ensure SWO on file before submitting claims.

5. **"DME Information Form not on file"** - Medicare documentation requirement. Fix: DME Information Form (supplier form) must be maintained documenting drug name, diagnosis, venous access type, pump type, treatment length, number of syringes per 30 days. Coordinate with supplier to complete form. Provide physician information as needed.

6. **"No covered pump on file"** - Pump authorization required. Fix: K0552 requires covered external drug infusion pump authorization (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455). Submit pump authorization first, then syringe cartridge claims. Supply follows pump coverage.

7. **"Drug/indication not covered"** - Non-covered drug/diagnosis. Fix: Verify drug meets covered criteria: chemotherapy (liver/colorectal cancer), morphine (cancer pain), deferoxamine (iron overload), epoprostenol/treprostinil (pulmonary hypertension), inotropics (Stage D heart failure), SCIg (immunodeficiency/CIDP), other drugs meeting ≥8 hour continuous OR strict rate control criteria. Non-covered drugs require individual medical review.

8. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Missing required authorization. Fix: NY Medicaid requires DVS (Dispensing Validation System) authorization for K0552. Submit DVS authorization request documenting drug, diagnosis, protocol, syringe frequency BEFORE billing. Authorization granted per syringe/cartridge based on protocol.

9. **"Must be billed by pharmacy"** (Medicaid) - Wrong provider type. Fix: K0552 has "pharmacy-only billing designation" for NY Medicaid. Must be billed by pharmacy or enrolled DMEPOS provider with pharmacy designation. Traditional DME suppliers without pharmacy enrollment cannot bill. Refer to pharmacy provider or enroll in pharmacy program.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **KX MODIFIER MANDATORY as of 3/1/2023** - do not forget!
- K0552 for non-insulin drug pumps ONLY - insulin pumps use A4225
- Maximize drug concentration to minimize syringes - utilization managed
- SWO and DME Info Form required - coordinate with supplier early
- No separate PA (follows pump authorization)

**Medicaid:**
- **DVS authorization required** - submit before billing
- **Pharmacy-only billing** - must use pharmacy provider or enrolled DMEPOS with pharmacy designation
- **MMC members: NYRx pharmacy program** (as of 4/1/2023) - pharmacy benefit pathway
- Contact NY Medicaid for current guidance: (800) 342-3005

**Documentation Best Practices:**

**Drug Concentration Maximization:**
- Document drug concentration used and maximum feasible concentration
- Example: "Epoprostenol 50,000 ng/mL (maximum concentration per manufacturer) - minimizes syringe changes to every 6 hours"
- If not using max concentration, explain constraint: "Morphine 20 mg/mL used (not max 50 mg/mL) due to patient subcutaneous site tolerance - higher concentrations cause site irritation"

**Quantity Calculation:**
- Calculate syringes per month based on protocol:
  - Determine volume per syringe (e.g., 10 mL)
  - Calculate infusion rate (e.g., 2 mL/hour)
  - Duration per syringe: 10 mL ÷ 2 mL/hour = 5 hours
  - Syringes per day: 24 hours ÷ 5 hours = 4.8 syringes/day (round up to 5)
  - Monthly quantity: 5 syringes/day × 30 days = 150 syringes/month
- Document calculation in order to justify quantity

**Treatment Protocol Documentation:**
- Specify infusion parameters clearly:
  - "Morphine 50 mg/mL, infusion rate 2 mg/hour = 0.04 mL/hour"
  - "10 mL syringe cartridge lasts 250 hours at 0.04 mL/hour" ← ERROR, should be: "10 mL syringe lasts 250 hours" is wrong calculation
  - Let me recalculate: 10 mL ÷ 0.04 mL/hour = 250 hours ← This seems too long
  - Actually: morphine 50 mg/mL at 2 mg/hour = 2 mg/hour ÷ 50 mg/mL = 0.04 mL/hour
  - 10 mL at 0.04 mL/hour = 10 ÷ 0.04 = 250 hours per syringe ← This is correct but seems unusually long
  - More typical example: "Morphine 10 mg/mL, rate 2 mg/hour = 0.2 mL/hour, 10 mL syringe lasts 50 hours"

**Example Documentation:**

**Example 1: Chemotherapy (Colorectal Cancer)**
- Drug: Fluorouracil (5-FU) 50 mg/mL
- Rate: 2 mg/hour continuous infusion (per protocol)
- Volume: 0.04 mL/hour
- Syringe size: 10 mL
- Duration per syringe: 10 mL ÷ 0.04 mL/hour = 250 hours (10.4 days)
- Syringes per month: ~3 syringes/month
- Concentration: Maximum per stability guidelines (50 mg/mL)

**Example 2: Morphine (Cancer Pain)**
- Drug: Morphine sulfate 10 mg/mL
- Rate: 5 mg/hour continuous
- Volume: 0.5 mL/hour
- Syringe size: 10 mL
- Duration per syringe: 10 mL ÷ 0.5 mL/hour = 20 hours
- Syringes per day: 24 ÷ 20 = 1.2 (round up to 2)
- Monthly quantity: 2/day × 30 = 60 syringes/month
- Concentration: 10 mg/mL (could maximize to 50 mg/mL to reduce syringes to 12/month)

**Example 3: Epoprostenol (Pulmonary Hypertension)**
- Drug: Epoprostenol (Flolan) 50,000 ng/mL
- Rate: 10 ng/kg/min (70 kg patient = 700 ng/min = 42,000 ng/hour = 42 mcg/hour)
- Volume: 42,000 ng/hour ÷ 50,000 ng/mL = 0.84 mL/hour
- Syringe size: 10 mL
- Duration per syringe: 10 ÷ 0.84 = 11.9 hours (~12 hours)
- Syringes per day: 24 ÷ 12 = 2
- Monthly quantity: 2/day × 30 = 60 syringes/month
- Concentration: Maximum per manufacturer (50,000 ng/mL) - cannot increase further

**KX Modifier Requirement (Medicare):**
- **Effective: March 1, 2023**
- **Required on ALL K0552 claims**
- KX indicates: Coverage criteria met for home infusion therapy
- Without KX: Claim automatically denied
- Include in all electronic and paper claims

**Pump Type Verification:**
- **Compatible pumps:** E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791, K0455 ✓
- **Incompatible pump:** E0784 (insulin pump) ✗ - use A4225 instead
- Verify pump code before ordering K0552
