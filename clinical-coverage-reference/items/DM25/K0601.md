# K0601 - Insulin Pump Battery (Silver Oxide 1.5V)

## Cross-Reference Note

**This code is documented in both DM24 and DM25 categories.**

**For complete coverage details, prescription requirements, denial reasons, and tips:** See **[DM24/K0601.md](../DM24/K0601.md)**

K0601 (Replacement battery, silver oxide, 1.5V) is used for external infusion pump batteries including:
- **DM24**: All external infusion pumps
- **DM25**: Insulin infusion pumps specifically

The coverage criteria are identical across both categories.

## Clinical Context for Insulin Pumps

For insulin pump (E0784) batteries:
- Silver oxide battery, 1.5 volt
- **For patient-owned pumps only** (not rental)
- Battery life varies by pump model
- Essential for uninterrupted insulin delivery

**Quantity**: Based on pump specifications and battery life per manufacturer guidelines

## Quick Coverage Summary

**Medicare**: Covered for patient-owned insulin pumps; no separate PA required; quantity per pump specifications

**NY Medicaid**: No separate PA required once pump owned by patient; quantity based on pump model
