# A4245 - Alcohol Prep Pads for Insulin Pump Catheter Site Care

## Cross-Reference Note

**This code is documented in both DM24 and DM25 categories.**

**For complete coverage details, prescription requirements, denial reasons, and tips:** See **[DM24/A4245.md](../DM24/A4245.md)**

A4245 (Alcohol wipes, per box) is used for catheter site care with:
- **DM24**: All external infusion pumps (chemotherapy, pain medication, deferoxamine, etc.)
- **DM25**: Insulin infusion pumps specifically

The coverage criteria are identical across both categories.

## Clinical Context for Insulin Pumps

For insulin pump (E0784) catheter site care:
- Pre-packaged alcohol prep pads (typically 70% isopropyl alcohol)
- Convenient single-use wipes for site preparation
- Used before each catheter insertion (typically every 2-3 days)
- Standard box: 100 wipes

**Typical usage**: 10-15 site preparations per month = 10-15 wipes/month (well below 100-count box)

## Quick Coverage Summary

**Medicare**: Covered with insulin pump (E0784); no separate PA required; quantity based on medical necessity

**NY Medicaid**: Direct bill; no PA required; quantity based on catheter care needs
