# A4225 - Insulin Pump Syringe Cartridge/Reservoir

## Clinical Overview

A4225 is a **syringe-type cartridge/reservoir** for external insulin infusion pumps. This code covers the disposable insulin reservoir/cartridge used in insulin pumps (CSII). All clinical and coverage requirements are **same as A4224** except A4225 is billed **per cartridge** (not weekly bundle) and **must be used only with insulin pump E0784**.

**CRITICAL: Must Bill ONLY with Insulin Pump E0784** - Claims with other pump codes (E0779-E0781, E0791, K0455) will be DENIED. For non-insulin pump syringe cartridges, use K0552.

**IMPORTANT: KX Modifier Required** - As of March 1, 2023, Medicare requires KX modifier on all A4225 claims.

**Key Features:**
- **Syringe-type cartridge** - disposable insulin reservoir for insulin pumps
- **Per cartridge billing** - billed per each cartridge used (vs. A4224 weekly bundle)
- **ONLY for insulin pump E0784** - claims with other pump codes DENIED
- **Same coverage as A4224** - same clinical criteria, documentation, requirements
- **KX modifier required** - mandatory as of 3/1/2023 for Medicare

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Type 1 diabetic on insulin pump (CSII) changing cartridge every 3 days
- Post-pancreatectomy patient refilling insulin reservoir every 2-3 days
- Pump uses cartridge/reservoir system requiring disposable sterile cartridges

**Coverage Criteria:**
**SAME AS A4224** - see A4224 for comprehensive coverage criteria

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (when insulin pump E0784 covered)

**Requirements:** **SAME AS A4224**
- **KX MODIFIER REQUIRED** (as of March 1, 2023)
- **CRITICAL: Must bill ONLY with insulin pump E0784** (claims with other pump codes E0779-E0781, E0791, K0455 DENIED)
- WOPD, C-peptide/autoantibody, 6-month MDI trial, glucose monitoring, diabetes education, glycemic control criteria, quarterly evaluations

See A4224 for detailed requirements.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:** **SAME AS A4224**
- Endocrinologist prescription required
- Patient ≥10 years old
- Education, maturity, adult involvement (ages 10-18)
- Pump E0784 authorized
- NYRx Pharmacy Benefit as of 4/1/2023

See A4224 for detailed requirements.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**SAME AS A4224** - see A4224 for comprehensive checklist

**Key differences:**
- [ ] **Supply code: "A4225 - Supplies for external insulin infusion pump, syringe type cartridge, sterile, each"**
- [ ] **Pump verification: MUST be E0784 (insulin pump)** - verify before ordering
  - [ ] If non-insulin pump (E0779-E0781, E0791, K0455), use K0552 instead
- [ ] **Quantity calculation:**
  - [ ] Cartridge capacity (e.g., 300 units)
  - [ ] Daily insulin requirement (e.g., 50 units/day)
  - [ ] Days per cartridge (300 ÷ 50 = 6 days)
  - [ ] Cartridges per month (30 ÷ 6 = 5 cartridges/month)

## Common Denial Reasons

**SAME AS A4224** plus:

**Additional A4225-specific denials:**

1. **"Cannot bill A4225 with pump code [E0779/E0780/E0781/E0791/K0455]"** - MOST COMMON A4225-SPECIFIC DENIAL. Wrong pump code. Fix: A4225 ONLY for insulin pump E0784. For non-insulin drug infusion pumps (E0779-E0781, E0791, K0455), use K0552 instead. Verify pump code on authorization - if not E0784, change supply code to K0552. **This is critical and will result in automatic denial if violated.**

2. **"Quantity not justified"** - Excessive cartridge quantity. Fix: Calculate cartridges needed based on: (1) Cartridge capacity (units), (2) Patient's daily insulin requirement (units/day), (3) Days per cartridge = capacity ÷ daily requirement, (4) Cartridges per month = 30 ÷ days per cartridge. Document calculation. Example: "Patient uses 45 units insulin/day, cartridge holds 300 units, lasts 6.7 days, requires 4.5 cartridges/month (round up to 5)."

**All other denials SAME AS A4224** - see A4224 for comprehensive denial reasons and fixes.

## Tips for Prescribers

**SAME AS A4224** except:

**CRITICAL - Pump Code Verification:**
- **A4225 ONLY for insulin pump E0784**
- **NOT for non-insulin pumps** (E0779-E0781, E0791, K0455)
- Verify pump code BEFORE ordering A4225
- If non-insulin pump, use K0552 for syringe cartridges

**Billing Difference - A4224 vs A4225:**
- **A4224:** Weekly bundled supplies (catheter maintenance, infusion sets, etc.)
- **A4225:** Per-cartridge billing for insulin reservoirs
- Both can be billed for same patient (weekly supplies + cartridge refills)
- Do not duplicate - A4224 may include some cartridges in bundle; A4225 for additional/replacement cartridges

**Quantity Calculation:**
- Cartridge capacity varies by pump model: 180-315 units typical
- Calculate based on patient's total daily insulin dose (basal + bolus)
- Days per cartridge = cartridge capacity ÷ daily insulin dose
- Monthly quantity = 30 days ÷ days per cartridge (round up)

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Low insulin requirement**
- Patient: 30 units/day total insulin
- Cartridge: 300 units capacity
- Days per cartridge: 300 ÷ 30 = 10 days
- Monthly quantity: 30 ÷ 10 = 3 cartridges/month

**Example 2: Moderate insulin requirement**
- Patient: 50 units/day total insulin
- Cartridge: 300 units capacity
- Days per cartridge: 300 ÷ 50 = 6 days
- Monthly quantity: 30 ÷ 6 = 5 cartridges/month

**Example 3: High insulin requirement**
- Patient: 100 units/day total insulin
- Cartridge: 300 units capacity
- Days per cartridge: 300 ÷ 100 = 3 days
- Monthly quantity: 30 ÷ 3 = 10 cartridges/month

**Example 4: Small cartridge capacity**
- Patient: 60 units/day total insulin
- Cartridge: 180 units capacity (smaller pump)
- Days per cartridge: 180 ÷ 60 = 3 days
- Monthly quantity: 30 ÷ 3 = 10 cartridges/month

**Documentation:**
- Specify pump model and cartridge capacity
- Document patient's total daily insulin dose (basal + average bolus)
- Calculate and justify monthly quantity
- Example: "Patient uses Medtronic 770G insulin pump (300-unit cartridge), requires 55 units/day total insulin (30 basal + 25 average bolus), cartridge lasts 5.5 days, needs 5.5 cartridges/month (6 cartridges ordered to ensure adequate supply)."

**Pump Model Examples (cartridge capacities):**
- Medtronic 770G/780G: 300 units
- Tandem t:slim X2: 300 units
- Omnipod DASH/5: 200 units (tubeless pod)
- Medtronic 630G: 300 units
- Older models may vary: 180-315 units

**All other documentation SAME AS A4224** - see A4224 for comprehensive guidance on C-peptide, MDI trial, glucose monitoring, glycemic control criteria, quarterly evaluations, Medicaid endocrinologist requirement, pediatric considerations, NYRx billing.
