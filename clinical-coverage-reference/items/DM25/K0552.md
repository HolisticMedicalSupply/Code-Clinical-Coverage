# K0552 - Insulin Pump Reservoir/Cartridge

## Cross-Reference Note

**This code is documented in both DM24 and DM25 categories.**

**For complete coverage details, prescription requirements, denial reasons, and tips:** See **[DM24/K0552.md](../DM24/K0552.md)**

K0552 (Syringe type cartridge, sterile, each) is used for external infusion pump reservoirs including:
- **DM24**: All external infusion pump cartridges
- **DM25**: Insulin infusion pump cartridges specifically

The coverage criteria are identical across both categories.

## Clinical Context for Insulin Pumps

For insulin pump (E0784) reservoirs:
- Sterile cartridge holds insulin within pump
- Capacity: typically 180-300 units depending on pump model
- Replaced every 2-3 days (with catheter change) or when depleted
- **Billed per each cartridge**

**Typical monthly usage**: 10-15 cartridges (based on every 2-3 day changes)

## Quick Coverage Summary

**Medicare**: Covered with insulin pump (E0784); no separate PA required; billed per each; quantity based on medical necessity

**NY Medicaid**: No separate PA required once pump authorized; quantity based on catheter change frequency

## Related Codes

- **A4224** - Supplies for maintenance of insulin infusion catheter, per week. Weekly bundled supplies (may include reservoirs). See DM25/A4224.md.
- **A4225** - Supplies for external insulin infusion pump, syringe type cartridge, sterile, each. Alternative code for same item - verify payer preference. See DM25/A4225.md.
- **E0784** - External ambulatory infusion pump, insulin. Insulin pump device. See DM13/E0784.md.

**Note**: Verify whether payer prefers K0552 or A4225 for insulin pump cartridges, and whether cartridges are included in A4224 weekly bundle or billed separately.
