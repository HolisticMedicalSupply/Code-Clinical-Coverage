## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"KX modifier not billed"** (Medicare - MOST COMMON as of 3/1/2023) - Missing required modifier. Fix: As of March 1, 2023, KX modifier MANDATORY on all A4224 Medicare claims. Add KX modifier to indicate coverage criteria met. Claims without KX automatically denied.

2. **"No C-peptide or autoantibody test documented"** (Medicare initial approval) - Missing biochemical confirmation. Fix: Must document C-peptide ≤110% lower limit normal (with fasting glucose ≤225) OR positive beta cell autoantibody (GAD, IA-2, ICA, ZnT8). Submit lab results with initial pump authorization. Not needed for supply refills if pump already authorized.

3. **"Inadequate MDI trial documentation"** (Medicare) - Insufficient MDI trial. Fix: Must document 6+ months on MDI with ≥3 injections/day and self-adjustments. Submit insulin regimen details: types of insulin, doses, injection times, patient self-adjustment examples, start date, duration. Need full 6 months documented.

4. **"Glucose self-testing <4 times/day or <2 months"** (Medicare) - Insufficient monitoring. Fix: Must document glucose self-testing ≥4 times/day for 2+ months. Submit glucose logs or meter downloads showing dates, times, values. Need minimum 2 months of ≥4 tests/day consistently.

5. **"No glycemic control criterion met"** (Medicare) - MDI appears adequate. Fix: Must meet at least ONE: (1) HbA1C >7% (submit lab result), (2) Recurring hypoglycemia (document episodes with glucose <70), (3) Wide fluctuations (calculate SD/CV from glucose logs), (4) Dawn phenomenon with fasting >200 (document AM readings), (5) Severe excursions (document hyper/hypoglycemic episodes). Demonstrate MDI inadequate.

6. **"Comprehensive diabetes education not documented"** (Medicare) - Missing education. Fix: Document formal diabetes education program: program name, dates, topics (insulin physiology, carb counting, hypoglycemia, sick days, pump training), patient competency demonstrated. Cannot be informal teaching - must be structured program.

7. **"No quarterly evaluation"** (Medicare supply refills) - Missing follow-up. Fix: Quarterly evaluations mandatory for continued coverage. Document visit every 3 months: glucose control assessment, HbA1C trends, hypoglycemia review, pump site assessment, continued medical necessity. If evaluations not maintained, supplies denied.

8. **"Not ordered by endocrinologist"** (Medicaid) - Wrong specialist. Fix: NY Medicaid requires endocrinologist specialized in diabetes. Primary care, family medicine, internal medicine cannot order insulin pumps/supplies. Refer to endocrinologist for pump management.

9. **"Patient under 10 years old"** (Medicaid) - Age restriction. Fix: NY Medicaid requires patient ≥10 years old. No coverage for children under 10. Patient must reach 10th birthday before pump authorization.

10. **"Maturity/adult involvement not documented for ages 10-18"** (Medicaid) - Pediatric requirements not met. Fix: For ages 10-18, must document: (1) Patient maturity for pump management (capable of site changes, carb counting, troubleshooting), (2) Supportive adult involvement (parent/guardian trained in pump, involved in daily management). Both required for adolescent coverage.

11. **"Pump (E0784) not authorized"** - No pump coverage. Fix: A4224 supplies require authorized insulin pump E0784. Submit pump PA first (Medicaid), then supply claims follow. Supplies cannot be covered without pump authorization.

12. **"Must bill through NYRx pharmacy"** (Medicaid as of 4/1/2023) - Wrong billing pathway. Fix: As of April 1, 2023, insulin infusion supplies transitioned to NYRx Pharmacy Benefit. May need to bill through pharmacy instead of DME. Contact NY Medicaid for current NYRx billing procedures: (800) 342-3005.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **KX MODIFIER MANDATORY as of 3/1/2023** - do not forget!
- **Initial pump approval:** Comprehensive documentation (C-peptide/autoantibody, 6-month MDI, glucose logs, education, glycemic control criterion)
- **Supply refills:** Quarterly evaluations mandatory - cannot skip
- All criteria must be met for initial approval; ongoing evaluations for continued coverage
- C-peptide or autoantibody only needed for initial pump approval (not supply refills)

**Medicaid:**
- **Endocrinologist specialist required** - primary care cannot order
- **Age ≥10 years** - no exceptions for younger children
- **Ages 10-18:** Must document maturity AND adult involvement
- **Pump PA first, supplies follow** - two-step process
- **NYRx Pharmacy Benefit as of 4/1/2023** - pharmacy billing pathway

**Documentation Best Practices:**

**C-peptide/Autoantibody Testing:**
- **C-peptide:** Fasting specimen, submit lab result showing value and lab's normal range
  - Calculate: (Patient C-peptide / Upper limit of normal) × 100 ≤ 110%
  - Example: Patient 0.8 ng/mL, Lab normal 0.9-3.7, Upper limit = 3.7
  - Calculation: (0.8 / 3.7) × 100 = 21.6% (well below 110% - qualifies)
- **Fasting glucose:** Must be ≤225 mg/dL at time of C-peptide
- **Autoantibody alternative:** GAD65, IA-2, ICA, or ZnT8 antibodies (any positive qualifies)

**MDI Trial Documentation:**
- Document insulin regimen: basal (NPH, glargine, detemir, degludec) + bolus (rapid-acting)
- Example: "Patient on glargine 24 units QHS, lispro 1:10 carb ratio before meals with correction factor 1:50, self-adjusts based on glucose readings and carb intake, started 8/1/2024, currently 2/1/2025 (6 months)"
- Show self-adjustment capability: "Patient independently adjusts lispro dose: 1 unit per 10g carbs + correction for glucose >140"

**Glucose Log Documentation:**
- Submit 2+ months of glucose logs showing ≥4 tests/day
- Meter downloads preferred (objective data)
- Include dates, times, values for each test
- Calculate average tests/day to demonstrate ≥4/day requirement met

**Glycemic Control Criterion Examples:**
- **HbA1C >7%:** "HbA1C 8.2% on 1/15/2025 despite optimal MDI with good compliance"
- **Recurring hypoglycemia:** "Hypoglycemia episodes (glucose <70 mg/dL): 12/5/24 (58 mg/dL), 12/18/24 (62 mg/dL), 1/8/25 (54 mg/dL), 1/22/25 (48 mg/dL) - 4 episodes in 2 months despite reducing basal insulin"
- **Wide fluctuations:** "Glucose SD 85 mg/dL, CV 42% (calculated from 60-day logs) - wide variability despite MDI optimization"
- **Dawn phenomenon:** "Fasting AM glucose consistently >200 despite evening basal adjustments: 1/1 (218), 1/3 (224), 1/5 (210), 1/7 (232), 1/9 (215)"

**Quarterly Evaluation Documentation:**
- Schedule every 3 months from pump start
- Document: glucose control (HbA1C, average glucose, time in range), hypoglycemia frequency, hyperglycemia management, pump site assessment (rotation, infections), patient competency, continued medical necessity
- Example: "Quarterly pump evaluation 3 months post-initiation: HbA1C improved to 6.8% (from 8.2% pre-pump), glucose variability decreased, no severe hypoglycemia, excellent site rotation, demonstrates competent pump management. Continue insulin pump therapy."

**Medicaid Endocrinologist Requirement:**
- Order must come from endocrinologist (MD/DO) with subspecialty in endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism
- Certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES) cannot independently order
- Nurse practitioner/PA working under endocrinologist may be acceptable - verify with NY Medicaid

**Pediatric/Adolescent Documentation (Ages 10-18):**
- Assess maturity: "Patient demonstrates understanding of carb counting, performs site changes independently, recognizes and treats hypoglycemia appropriately, troubleshoots pump alarms"
- Document adult involvement: "Parent trained in pump management, supervises site changes, reviews glucose data daily, available for decision-making support"
- Both elements required for ages 10-18

**NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition:**
- As of 4/1/2023, supplies transitioned to pharmacy benefit
- Traditional DME billing may no longer be appropriate
- Contact NY Medicaid for current procedures: (800) 342-3005
- May need to coordinate with pharmacy provider for supply dispensing
