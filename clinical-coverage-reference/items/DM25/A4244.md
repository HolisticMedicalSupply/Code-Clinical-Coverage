# A4244 - Antiseptic Solution for Insulin Pump Catheter Site Care

## Cross-Reference Note

**This code is documented in both DM24 and DM25 categories.**

**For complete coverage details, prescription requirements, denial reasons, and tips:** See **[DM24/A4244.md](../DM24/A4244.md)**

A4244 (Alcohol or peroxide, per pint) is used for catheter site care with:
- **DM24**: All external infusion pumps (chemotherapy, pain medication, deferoxamine, etc.)
- **DM25**: Insulin infusion pumps specifically

The coverage criteria are identical across both categories.

## Clinical Context for Insulin Pumps

For insulin pump (E0784) catheter site care:
- Site cleaned before each catheter insertion (typically every 2-3 days)
- Alcohol most common antiseptic
- ~10 mL per site preparation
- Example usage: 10 changes/month Ã— 10 mL = 100 mL/month = 0.21 pints/month

**Medicaid quantity limit**: Up to 5 pints per 30 days (well above typical insulin pump needs)

## Quick Coverage Summary

**Medicare**: Covered with insulin pump (E0784); no separate PA required; quantity based on medical necessity

**NY Medicaid**: Direct bill; up to 5 pints per 30 days; exceeding limit requires PA
