# E0784 - External Ambulatory Insulin Infusion Pump

## Clinical Overview

E0784 represents an external ambulatory insulin infusion pump (commonly called an insulin pump) used for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. This sophisticated device delivers precise amounts of rapid-acting insulin continuously throughout the day and night, mimicking the body's natural insulin secretion pattern more closely than multiple daily injections (MDI). Insulin pumps allow for flexible basal rates, correction boluses, and meal-time insulin delivery with fine-tuned control. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** Both Medicare and NY Medicaid have STRICT eligibility criteria requiring documented failure of intensive MDI therapy for at least 6 months before pump approval. This is not a first-line diabetes treatment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Insufficient MDI trial"** - Less than 6 months documented. Fix: Must document full 6-month MDI trial with ≥3 injections/day before pump approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No glucose monitoring logs"** - Missing ≥2 months of ≥4 tests/day. Fix: Submit complete glucose logs showing ≥4 tests per day for at least 2 months. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Diabetes education not completed"** - No certificate. Fix: Patient must complete comprehensive diabetes self-management education program first. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"C-peptide criteria not met"** - C-peptide too high or missing. Fix: Obtain C-peptide ≤110% lower limit normal with fasting glucose ≤225 mg/dL OR beta cell autoantibody test. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Medical necessity not established"** - No documented inadequate control with MDI. Fix: Document HbA1c >7%, hypoglycemia, wide fluctuations, or dawn phenomenon despite optimal MDI. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No prior authorization"** (Medicaid) - Authorization not obtained. Fix: Contact Magellan (877-309-9493) for prior authorization before ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"Non-specialist order"** (Medicaid) - Primary care physician order. Fix: Obtain order from endocrinologist or experienced diabetes practitioner. *(Under Review)*

8. **"Missing WOPD"** (Medicare) - Order not completed before delivery. Fix: Complete Written Order Prior to Delivery before dispensing pump. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
