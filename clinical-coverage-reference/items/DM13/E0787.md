## Replacement Codes

For non-insulin external ambulatory infusion pumps, use the following valid codes based on clinical indication:

### **E0779** - Ambulatory Infusion Pump (Insulin Pump with Dosage Rate Adjustment)
- For insulin pumps with dosage rate adjustment capabilities
- See DM12 category documentation for coverage criteria
- Requires infusion ≥8 hours OR intermittent <8 hours where toxicity unavoidable without rate control
- KX modifier required when Medicare criteria met *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### **E0780** - Ambulatory Infusion Pump (Programmable)
- For programmable infusion pumps
- See DM12 category documentation for coverage criteria
- Used for chemotherapy, chronic iron overload, intractable cancer pain, etc.
- KX modifier required when Medicare criteria met *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### **E0781** - Ambulatory Infusion Pump (Without Rate Adjustment)
- For single or multiple channel pumps without rate adjustment
- See DM12 category documentation for coverage criteria
- Used for intermittent infusions where rate control not needed
- KX modifier required when Medicare criteria met *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### **E0791** - Parenteral Infusion Pump (Stationary)
- For stationary parenteral infusion pumps (single or multi-channel)
- See DM14 category documentation if available
- Used for continuous home infusion therapy *(Under Review)*

## Historical Information (Pre-September 2020)

**Prior to discontinuation**, E0787 was used for external ambulatory infusion pumps, particularly those with insulin dosage rate adjustment using therapeutic continuous glucose sensing. This code has been replaced by more specific codes that better describe the pump type and clinical application. *(Under Review)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**NOT COVERED** - Code discontinued September 15, 2020 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

All claims submitted with E0787 after September 15, 2020 will be denied as invalid code. Providers must use appropriate replacement codes (E0779, E0780, E0781, E0791) based on:
- Pump technology (programmable vs. non-programmable)
- Infusion type (continuous vs. intermittent)
- Clinical indication (chemotherapy, insulin, pain management, etc.)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**NOT COVERED** - Code discontinued *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Use appropriate replacement codes based on clinical indication and pump specifications.

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**NOT COVERED** - Code discontinued *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Same as Nassau County. Use replacement codes.

## What to Do If You Receive This Code

**If a prescription or order references E0787:**

1. **Contact the ordering physician** to clarify the clinical indication and pump type needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Determine the correct replacement code** based on:
   - Is this for insulin infusion? → Consider **E0779**
   - Is this for chemotherapy or other non-insulin infusion? → Consider **E0780** or **E0781**
   - Is this for stationary home infusion? → Consider **E0791**

3. **Obtain a new prescription** with the correct valid HCPCS code *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **Do NOT submit claims** with E0787 - claims will be denied *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**If a claim denial references E0787:**
- Resubmit claim with appropriate replacement code (E0779, E0780, E0781, or E0791)
- Include updated physician order with valid code
- Add KX modifier if Medicare criteria met
- Reference discontinuation date (9/15/2020) in appeal if needed

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I still bill E0787 for services provided before September 2020?**
A: Claims for dates of service BEFORE September 15, 2020 may be processed with E0787 if within the timely filing limits. For services ON or AFTER September 15, 2020, E0787 is invalid. *(Under Review)*

**Q: What's the difference between E0779, E0780, and E0781?**
A:
- **E0779**: Insulin pump with dosage rate adjustment
- **E0780**: Programmable ambulatory infusion pump (non-insulin)
- **E0781**: Non-programmable ambulatory infusion pump without rate adjustment
See DM12 category documentation for detailed coverage criteria. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Q: Do the replacement codes require prior authorization?**
A: Coverage requirements vary by code and payer. For NY Medicaid, most external infusion pumps require DVS authorization. For Medicare, Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) is required. See individual code documentation for specific requirements. *(Under Review)*
