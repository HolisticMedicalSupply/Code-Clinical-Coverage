# E0764 - Functional Electrical Stimulation for SCI Walking

## Clinical Overview

E0764 represents a sophisticated functional electrical stimulation (FES) system designed for spinal cord injury (SCI) patients to achieve standing and walking function. The system uses computer-controlled transcutaneous electrical stimulation of sequential muscle groups to produce coordinated lower extremity movements for ambulation. Unlike simple NMES for muscle strengthening, this is a complete functional ambulation system with dynamic bracing that enables paralyzed individuals to stand and walk using electrical stimulation of their paralyzed but innervated muscles. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** E0764 has the MOST STRINGENT requirements of any NMES device. **MANDATORY: Patient MUST complete 32 physical therapy training sessions over 3 months BEFORE device authorization.** This training period demonstrates device effectiveness, patient motivation, and functional benefit. All 5 NCD criteria must be met. Prior authorization REQUIRED for both Medicare and Medicaid. This is a high-cost, complex system requiring comprehensive documentation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Training not completed"** - <32 PT sessions documented. Fix: MUST complete full 32 PT training sessions over minimum 3 months BEFORE device authorization. This is MANDATORY with no exceptions. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Training period <3 months"** - Training compressed into shorter timeframe. Fix: 32 PT sessions must occur over 3+ months. Cannot compress into 1-2 months. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Inadequate training documentation"** - Sessions not fully documented. Fix: All 32 sessions must be documented with dates, duration, activities, functional assessments, and patient progress. PT notes required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"NCD criteria not met"** - Missing or inadequate documentation of 5 criteria. Fix: ALL 5 NCD criteria must be comprehensively documented. Each criterion requires specific evidence (EMG, ROM measurements, age verification, training completion). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No brisk muscle contraction documented"** - Muscle response inadequate. Fix: EMG or clinical testing must show brisk, vigorous muscle contraction to electrical stimulation. Weak or absent response = not appropriate candidate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Contractures/ROM limitations"** - Insufficient joint mobility. Fix: Patient must have adequate joint ROM for functional positioning and weight-bearing. Severe contractures make device ineffective. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"Patient motivation questionable"** - Poor compliance during training. Fix: Training period assesses motivation. Patient must demonstrate commitment through consistent attendance, effort, and compliance with 32-session program. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"No prior authorization"** - Device ordered before approval. Fix: Prior authorization MANDATORY before device order. High-cost device will not be covered without pre-approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Complete 32 PT training sessions FIRST** - Cannot skip this requirement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document training thoroughly:
  - All 32 session dates and durations
  - Functional assessments at beginning, middle, end of training
  - Patient progress throughout (e.g., "Session 1: stood 30 seconds → Session 32: stood 10 minutes, walked 25 feet")
  - Patient motivation and compliance clear
  - Final PT evaluation supporting device medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- ALL 5 NCD criteria documented comprehensively:
  - EMG showing brisk contraction
  - ROM measurements for all major joints
  - Age/skeletal maturity confirmed
  - Training completion proves criterion 5 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Physiatry or SCI specialist evaluation essential *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Home environment assessed for safe device use *(Under Review)*
- Submit prior authorization with complete documentation package *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
