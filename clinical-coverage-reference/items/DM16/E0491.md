# E0491 - Oral Device/Appliance for Tongue NMES (90-day supply)

## Clinical Overview

E0491 represents the oral device/appliance component used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the tongue muscle. This appliance works in conjunction with the E0490 power source and control electronics unit to deliver controlled electrical stimulation to tongue muscles. The oral appliance is placed in the patient's mouth and interfaces with the power unit via hardware remote control. Each E0491 unit represents a 90-day supply of the oral appliance, which may require periodic replacement due to wear or hygiene considerations. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** E0491 CANNOT be billed without active E0490 power source coverage. The oral appliance is non-functional without the power unit. Coverage criteria are identical to E0490 - prior authorization REQUIRED for Medicare, prior approval REQUIRED for NY Medicaid. This is a specialized device with LIMITED and UNCLEAR coverage. Verify with payers BEFORE prescribing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: LIMITED - Must Have Active E0490 Coverage**

E0491 coverage is directly tied to E0490 power source coverage. Cannot be approved without E0490.

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Active E0490 power source coverage** - E0491 is non-functional without E0490 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Same medical necessity criteria as E0490:**
   - Specific diagnosis requiring tongue NMES (dysphagia, speech disorder, oral motor dysfunction)
   - Failed conservative therapy documented
   - Meets NCD 160.12 criteria for neuromuscular stimulation *(Under Review)*

**Quantity and Frequency:**

- **90-day supply per unit** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Maximum 1 unit per 90 days
- Replacement as needed based on wear/hygiene (verify coverage for replacements)

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Prior authorization REQUIRED** (same as E0490) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Active E0490 power source prescription and coverage
- Same clinical documentation as E0490:
  - Diagnosis requiring tongue NMES
  - Failed conservative treatments
  - Specialist evaluation (recommended)
  - Expected functional improvement
- Standard Written Order (SWO)

**Important Notes:**

- Must verify coverage with Medicare MAC before prescribing
- Limited coverage information available - not routine coverage
- E0490 and E0491 typically covered together as complete system
- Replacement frequency may vary - verify with MAC

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: UNKNOWN - Requires Prior Approval with E0490**

NY Medicaid coverage for E0491 requires:

**Prior Approval Process:**

- Contact **Bureau of Medical Review** at **(800) 342-3005** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must have approved E0490 power source
- Same clinical justification as E0490 required
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber

**Quantity and Frequency:**

- 1 unit per 90 days *(Under Review)*
- Replacement as medically necessary

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be approved without E0490 coverage
- Case-by-case determination
- Not listed in routine DME manual

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** Requires prior approval via Bureau of Medical Review with active E0490 coverage.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**IMPORTANT:** E0491 should be prescribed TOGETHER with E0490 as a complete system.

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0491 - Oral device/appliance for tongue NMES, 90-day supply"
- [ ] **E0490 power source ALSO prescribed** (required for functional system)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (same as E0490)
- [ ] Quantity: 1 unit (90-day supply)
- [ ] Expected duration of therapy
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Prior authorization obtained for BOTH E0490 and E0491
- [ ] E0490 power source coverage approved
- [ ] Same clinical documentation as E0490 submitted

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Prior approval obtained for BOTH E0490 and E0491
- [ ] Bureau of Medical Review contacted (800-342-3005)
- [ ] E0490 coverage approved before requesting E0491

## Common Issues

1. **"E0491 ordered without E0490"** - Appliance ordered alone. Fix: E0491 oral appliance is non-functional without E0490 power source. Must order BOTH codes together as complete system. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No E0490 coverage"** - E0491 requested but E0490 denied. Fix: E0491 cannot be covered without active E0490 coverage. Address E0490 denial first before requesting E0491. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Prior authorization not obtained"** - Device ordered without PA. Fix: E0491 requires prior authorization (Medicare) or prior approval (Medicaid) just like E0490. Obtain authorization BEFORE delivery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Replacement frequency unclear"** - Requesting replacements. Fix: E0491 is 90-day supply, but replacement frequency may vary. Contact payer to verify replacement coverage before ordering additional units. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Always request E0490 and E0491 TOGETHER as complete system *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Prior authorization required for BOTH codes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Cannot obtain E0491 coverage without approved E0490 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Same clinical documentation requirements as E0490 *(Under Review)*
- Verify replacement coverage frequency with MAC *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review for BOTH E0490 and E0491 together *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Prior approval required for BOTH codes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- E0490 must be approved before E0491 can be considered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Same clinical justification as E0490 required *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0490** - Power source for oral device/tongue NMES - REQUIRED for E0491 to function. Must be covered before E0491 can be approved. See DM16 category. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **A4595** - Electrical stimulator supplies - Different supply code for traditional NMES/TENS devices. NOT used with E0490/E0491 tongue system. See DM16 category. *(Under Review)*
