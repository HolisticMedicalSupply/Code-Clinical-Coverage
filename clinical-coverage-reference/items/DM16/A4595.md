# A4595 - Electrical Stimulator Supplies, 2 Lead, Per Month

## Clinical Overview

A4595 represents a comprehensive monthly supply kit for patients using covered neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) devices. This all-inclusive supply code bundles all necessary components for one month of electrical stimulation therapy: disposable electrodes, conductive gel or paste, batteries for device operation, and adhesive tape for electrode placement. The kit ensures patients have all supplies needed for effective and continuous electrical stimulation therapy without separate billing for individual components. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** A4595 includes ALL supplies needed for monthly NMES/TENS use. Do not bill electrodes (A4556, A4557), conductive gel (A4558), batteries, or tape separately - all components are bundled into this single monthly code. Maximum 1 unit per month for 2-lead systems, 2 units per month for 4-lead systems. Patient must have an active covered NMES/TENS device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Active covered NMES/TENS device** - Patient must have an approved device:
   - **E0745** - Neuromuscular stimulator for disuse atrophy (see DM16)
   - **E0764** - Functional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury (see DM16)
   - **E0731** - Form fitting conductive garment (see DM16)
   - **E0730** - TENS device (see DM22 category) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Medical necessity for electrical stimulation:**
   - Disuse atrophy with intact nerve supply, OR
   - Functional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury patients, OR
   - Pain management via TENS when medically necessary *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **Ongoing device use** - Patient actively using device for covered indication *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity Limits:**

- **2-lead system:** Maximum **1 unit per month** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **4-lead system:** Maximum **2 units per month** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**What's Included in A4595:**

Each unit includes sufficient supplies for one month of therapy:
- Disposable electrodes (quantity based on recommended replacement schedule)
- Conductive gel or paste (A4558 bundled)
- Batteries for device operation
- Adhesive tape for electrode placement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**

- **Do NOT bill component codes separately:** A4556 (TENS electrodes), A4557 (TENS electrodes 4-lead), A4558 (conductive gel), batteries, or tape - all bundled into A4595 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No prior authorization required if within frequency limits
- Requires covered NMES/TENS device on file with active order
- Patient must be actively using device for covered indication

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Active NMES/TENS device prescription (E0745, E0764, E0731, or E0730)
- Diagnosis supporting electrical stimulation therapy
- Device type and lead configuration (2-lead vs. 4-lead)
- Medical records showing ongoing device use

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - active covered NMES/TENS device required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity Limits:**
- **2-lead system:** 1 unit per month
- **4-lead system:** 2 units per month *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **DVS authorization REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- Must have approved NMES device (E0745, E0764, E0731, or E0730) with DVS authorization
- Document lead configuration (2-lead vs. 4-lead) if requesting 2 units/month
- Ongoing medical necessity for electrical stimulation therapy

**Important Notes:**

- Direct bill through DME provider
- All supplies bundled - no separate billing for electrodes, gel, batteries, or tape
- DVS authorization ties to underlying device approval
- Monthly refills require patient contact and affirmative response

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, DVS authorization, and quantity limits are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "A4595 - Electrical stimulator supplies, 2 lead, per month"
- [ ] Active NMES/TENS device code (E0745, E0764, E0731, or E0730)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code supporting electrical stimulation need
- [ ] Lead configuration: 2-lead or 4-lead system
- [ ] Quantity: 1 unit/month (2-lead) or 2 units/month (4-lead)
- [ ] Expected duration of therapy
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Covered NMES/TENS device prescription on file
- [ ] Document ongoing medical necessity for device use
- [ ] Confirm lead configuration matches device

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization obtained for A4595
- [ ] Underlying NMES/TENS device has active DVS authorization
- [ ] Fiscal order specifies lead configuration
- [ ] Direct bill setup with DME supplier

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No active NMES/TENS device coverage"** - Device not approved or expired. Fix: Cannot bill A4595 without active covered NMES/TENS device (E0745, E0764, E0731, or E0730). Ensure device coverage is active before billing supplies. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Quantity exceeds limit"** - More than 1 unit requested for 2-lead or >2 units for 4-lead. Fix: Maximum 1 unit/month for 2-lead systems, 2 units/month for 4-lead systems. Document 4-lead configuration if requesting 2 units. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Duplicate billing with component codes"** - A4595 billed with A4556, A4557, or A4558. Fix: Do NOT bill electrodes (A4556/A4557) or gel (A4558) separately when billing A4595. All components are bundled. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No DVS authorization"** (Medicaid) - A4595 billed without DVS. Fix: Obtain DVS authorization for A4595 before billing. Ensure underlying device also has DVS authorization. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Lead configuration not documented"** - Requesting 2 units without 4-lead justification. Fix: If billing 2 units per month, document patient has 4-lead NMES/TENS system requiring double supply quantity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Device not in active use"** - Patient not using device regularly. Fix: A4595 only covered when patient actively using device for covered indication. Discontinue supplies if device no longer in use. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Ensure active covered NMES/TENS device on file (E0745, E0764, E0731, E0730) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Limit quantities to 1 unit/month (2-lead) or 2 units/month (4-lead) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Do NOT bill component codes separately (A4556, A4557, A4558, batteries, tape) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document device type and lead configuration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Verify patient actively using device for covered indication *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No PA required if within frequency limits *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- Obtain DVS authorization for A4595 before billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Verify underlying NMES/TENS device has active DVS authorization *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document lead configuration (2-lead vs. 4-lead) in fiscal order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Direct bill through DME provider *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- All supply components bundled - no separate billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Monthly refills require patient contact and affirmative response *(Under Review)*
