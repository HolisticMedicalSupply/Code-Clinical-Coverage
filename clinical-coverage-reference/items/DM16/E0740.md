# E0740 - Non-Implanted Pelvic Floor Electrical Stimulator

## Clinical Overview

E0740 represents a non-implanted pelvic floor electrical stimulator used for neuromuscular reeducation of pelvic floor muscles in patients with urinary incontinence. The device delivers controlled electrical stimulation to pelvic floor muscles to improve muscle strength, coordination, and continence control. This therapy is indicated for stress incontinence, urge incontinence, or mixed incontinence in cognitively intact patients who can understand and operate the device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** E0740 has a **MANDATORY requirement** per Medicare NCD 230.8: Patient MUST have documented failure of a 4-week pelvic muscle exercise (PME) training program before E0740 authorization. No exceptions. Prior approval typically required for both Medicare and Medicaid. Patient must be cognitively intact and able to use device independently or with caregiver assistance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements - ALL Must Be Met:**

1. **Urinary incontinence diagnosis:**
   - Stress incontinence (involuntary leakage with cough, sneeze, exertion), OR
   - Urge incontinence (involuntary leakage with sudden urge to void), OR
   - Mixed incontinence (combination of stress and urge) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **MANDATORY: Failed 4-week pelvic muscle exercise (PME) trial** - Per NCD 230.8, patient MUST have documented 4-week trial of PME training that failed to adequately improve incontinence *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **Cognitive status:** Patient must be cognitively intact, able to:
   - Understand device instructions
   - Operate device independently or with caregiver assistance
   - Follow treatment protocol *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **Baseline severity documentation:** Incontinence severity documented (frequency of episodes, pad usage, impact on activities) *(Under Review)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Prior approval typically required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Standard Written Order (SWO)
- **MANDATORY: 4-week PME trial documentation** including:
  - Start date and end date of PME trial (minimum 4 weeks)
  - PME training provided (pelvic floor exercises, Kegel exercises)
  - Patient compliance with PME program
  - Results: Inadequate improvement in incontinence symptoms
  - Why PME trial considered failed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Cognitive status assessment:** Document patient is cognitively intact and can use device
- **Incontinence type:** Specify stress, urge, or mixed incontinence
- **Baseline severity:** Frequency of incontinent episodes, pad usage per day, functional impact
- Treatment plan and expected outcomes
- Urological or urogynecological evaluation (recommended)

**Important Notes:**

- NCD 230.8 governs coverage - 4-week PME failure is non-negotiable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Prior approval recommended before device order
- Patient must be able to operate device (cognitive intact, physical ability)
- Follow-up evaluations to assess effectiveness recommended

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- Complete 4-week PME trial documentation:
  - Dates of PME program (start/end)
  - PME training details
  - Patient compliance
  - Failed outcome with rationale *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Cognitive status assessment documented
- Incontinence type and severity documented
- Urological evaluation recommended

**Important Notes:**

- Same NCD 230.8 requirements as Medicare
- Prior approval and DVS authorization mandatory
- Case-by-case determination based on medical necessity

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, prior approval, DVS authorization, and mandatory 4-week PME failure documentation are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0740 - Non-implanted pelvic floor electrical stimulator"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code for incontinence type (N39.3, N39.41, N39.46)
- [ ] **MANDATORY: 4-week PME trial documentation:**
  - [ ] Start date and end date (minimum 4 weeks)
  - [ ] Type of PME training provided (Kegel exercises, pelvic floor PT)
  - [ ] Patient compliance with program
  - [ ] Outcome: Failed to adequately improve incontinence
  - [ ] Rationale for failure (minimal improvement, no improvement, worsening)
- [ ] **Cognitive status assessment:**
  - [ ] Patient is cognitively intact
  - [ ] Able to understand device instructions
  - [ ] Able to operate device independently or with caregiver
- [ ] **Incontinence severity baseline:**
  - [ ] Type: Stress, urge, or mixed
  - [ ] Frequency of incontinent episodes per day/week
  - [ ] Pad usage per day
  - [ ] Impact on activities of daily living
- [ ] Expected treatment duration
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Prior approval requested (recommended)
- [ ] NCD 230.8 requirements documented (4-week PME failure)
- [ ] Patient education plan for device use

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Prior approval obtained BEFORE ordering
- [ ] DVS authorization obtained
- [ ] All Medicare requirements documented
- [ ] Fiscal order includes comprehensive justification

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No documented 4-week PME trial"** - Missing or inadequate PME documentation. Fix: MUST document complete 4-week PME program with dates, training type, compliance, and failed outcome. This is MANDATORY per NCD 230.8. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"PME trial <4 weeks"** - Trial too short. Fix: PME trial must be MINIMUM 4 weeks. 2-week or 3-week trial is insufficient. Document full 4-week program. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Cognitive status not assessed"** - No cognition documentation. Fix: Document patient is cognitively intact, understands instructions, and can operate device. Mini-Mental State Exam or clinical assessment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Incontinence type not specified"** - Generic "incontinence" diagnosis. Fix: Specify stress, urge, or mixed incontinence. Different types have different mechanisms - document specific type. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No baseline severity"** - Severity not quantified. Fix: Document frequency of incontinent episodes, pad usage per day, and functional impact. Needed to assess device effectiveness later. *(Under Review)*

6. **"Patient not appropriate candidate"** - Cognitive impairment or inability to use device. Fix: E0740 requires patient able to understand and operate device. If cognitively impaired or physically unable, device not appropriate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Ordered without PA. Fix: Obtain prior approval and DVS authorization BEFORE ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **MANDATORY: Document complete 4-week PME trial** - This is THE critical requirement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- PME trial documentation should include:
  - Exact start and end dates (e.g., "PME trial 1/5/2025 to 2/2/2025 = 4 weeks")
  - Type of exercises (Kegel exercises, pelvic floor PT with therapist)
  - Patient compliance ("Patient performed 3 sets of 10 Kegels daily as instructed")
  - Outcome ("Despite 4-week compliant PME trial, patient continues 8-10 incontinent episodes/day")
  - Why failed ("Minimal improvement - insufficient for functional continence") *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document cognitive status clearly ("Patient alert, oriented, able to follow instructions") *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify incontinence type (stress, urge, mixed) with mechanism *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quantify severity with numbers (episodes per day, pads per day) *(Under Review)*
- Urological or urogynecological evaluation strengthens case *(Under Review)*
- Request prior approval before ordering to avoid post-delivery denial *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- All Medicare requirements apply - especially 4-week PME failure *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering - mandatory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Obtain DVS authorization *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order must include comprehensive 4-week PME trial documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Urological specialist evaluation helpful for approval *(Under Review)*
- Document patient education plan for device use *(Under Review)*
