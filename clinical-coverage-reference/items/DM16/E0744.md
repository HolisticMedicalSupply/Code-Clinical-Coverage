# E0744 - Neuromuscular Stimulator for Scoliosis (NOT COVERED)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NON-COVERAGE ALERT ⚠️

**E0744 is NOT COVERED by Medicare or NY Medicaid.** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicare:** Listed as experimental/investigational per NCD 160.12. Claims denied as not reasonable and necessary.

**NY Medicaid:** Not covered - follows Medicare determination.

**DO NOT prescribe E0744 for Medicare or Medicaid patients.** Claims will be automatically denied.

## Clinical Overview

E0744 represents a neuromuscular electrical stimulator intended for scoliosis treatment. The device would theoretically provide electrical stimulation to paraspinal muscles to influence spinal curvature in scoliosis patients. However, there is **insufficient scientific evidence** supporting the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation for scoliosis management. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**WHY NOT COVERED:**

Medicare has evaluated neuromuscular electrical stimulation for scoliosis and determined it is **experimental/investigational** with insufficient evidence of clinical effectiveness. The treatment does not meet the "reasonable and necessary" standard required for Medicare coverage under NCD 160.12. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**NOT COVERED - Experimental/Investigational**

E0744 is explicitly **NOT COVERED** by Medicare per NCD 160.12 (Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Rationale for Non-Coverage:**

- Insufficient evidence of effectiveness for scoliosis treatment via NMES
- Listed as experimental/investigational technology
- Does not meet "reasonable and necessary" standard
- Evidence does not support clinical benefit *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Claims Outcome:**

- All E0744 claims **DENIED** as not reasonable and necessary
- No amount of documentation will result in coverage
- Do NOT prescribe for Medicare patients *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**NOT COVERED**

NY Medicaid follows Medicare's determination that neuromuscular electrical stimulation for scoliosis is experimental/investigational. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Claims Outcome:**

- E0744 **NOT listed** in NY Medicaid DME manual as covered item
- Claims will be **DENIED**
- Prior approval requests will be denied
- Do NOT prescribe for Medicaid patients *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**NOT COVERED** - Same as Nassau County. Follows Medicare non-coverage determination.

## Alternative Treatment Options

Since E0744 NMES for scoliosis is not covered, consider these evidence-based alternatives:

**Covered Scoliosis Treatments:**

1. **Physical therapy** - Exercise-based scoliosis-specific therapy (covered with authorization)
2. **Bracing** - Orthotic devices for scoliosis management (covered under orthotics benefit)
3. **Chiropractic care** - May be covered with limitations (verify coverage)
4. **Pain management** - If scoliosis causing pain, covered pain treatments available
5. **Surgical intervention** - For severe progressive scoliosis (hospital-based, not DME)

**What to Tell Patients:**

- NMES for scoliosis is not covered by Medicare or Medicaid
- Insufficient evidence supporting NMES effectiveness for scoliosis
- If patient wants NMES for scoliosis, it would be **out-of-pocket/private pay only**
- Recommend evidence-based covered alternatives (PT, bracing, etc.)

## Prescription Guidance

**DO NOT prescribe E0744 for Medicare or Medicaid patients.** Claims will be denied.

**If Patient Requests NMES for Scoliosis:**

1. **Explain non-coverage:** Medicare and Medicaid do not cover E0744 due to lack of evidence
2. **Discuss alternatives:** Recommend evidence-based covered treatments (PT, bracing)
3. **Private pay option:** If patient insists, explain it would be out-of-pocket expense (not billable to insurance)
4. **Document conversation:** Note in chart that patient informed of non-coverage and alternatives offered

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I appeal an E0744 denial?**
A: No. E0744 is categorically not covered per NCD 160.12. Appeals will not result in coverage. This is a policy-based non-coverage decision, not a medical necessity determination. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Q: What if patient has private insurance?**
A: Private insurance may have different policies. Check with specific plan, but many follow Medicare policies for experimental/investigational technologies. *(Under Review)*

**Q: Is there any situation where E0744 would be covered?**
A: No. Medicare and NY Medicaid categorically do not cover E0744. Coverage policy would need to change based on new evidence, which has not occurred. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Q: Can patient pay out-of-pocket for E0744?**
A: Yes, if patient chooses to purchase device privately (not through insurance), they may do so at their own expense. However, inform patient of lack of evidence supporting effectiveness. *(Under Review)*
