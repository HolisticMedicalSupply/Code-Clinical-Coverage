# E0745 - Neuromuscular Stimulator for Disuse Atrophy

## Clinical Overview

E0745 represents a neuromuscular electrical stimulator (NMES) used for disuse atrophy prevention and treatment. The device delivers controlled electrical stimulation to muscles that have atrophied due to disuse, immobilization, or neurological injury (with intact nerve supply). NMES works by artificially activating muscle contractions to prevent or reverse muscle wasting, maintain muscle mass, and facilitate neuromuscular reeducation. This is the most common NMES device for home use in post-surgical recovery, stroke rehabilitation, and orthopedic conditions. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** E0745 requires documentation of intact nerve supply (brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves). If denervation injury (complete nerve damage), NMES is NOT appropriate. Must document failed conservative therapy (physical therapy, exercise programs). Medicare coverage under NCD 160.12 - no prior authorization required if criteria met, but WOPD required. Medicaid requires DVS authorization. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements - ALL Must Be Met:**

1. **Disuse atrophy diagnosis** - Muscle wasting/atrophy from disuse, immobilization, or neurological injury *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Intact nerve supply** - Patient MUST have intact innervation from:
   - Brain (upper motor neuron)
   - Spinal cord
   - Peripheral nerves (lower motor neuron)
   - **If denervation injury (complete nerve damage):** NMES not appropriate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **Confirmation of nerve integrity:**
   - Clinical examination showing muscle contraction to voluntary effort
   - EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) if nerve integrity questioned
   - Document that muscle has capability to contract *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **Failed conservative therapy** - Must document trial of:
   - Physical therapy
   - Home exercise program
   - Active or passive range of motion exercises
   - Inadequate response to conservative measures *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Common Clinical Indications (All require intact nerve supply):**

- Post-surgical atrophy (knee, hip, shoulder surgery)
- Muscle contractures from scarring or burns
- Post-major knee surgery with failed PT
- Post-hip replacement immobilization
- Stroke with paresis (hemiparesis, hemiplegia with some preserved function)
- Peripheral nerve injury with intact innervation
- Prolonged immobilization causing disuse atrophy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Diagnosis causing muscle atrophy (ICD-10 code)
- **Confirmation of intact nerve supply:**
  - Clinical exam: Muscle contracts voluntarily (even if weak)
  - EMG/NCS results if nerve integrity questioned
  - Document muscle can respond to electrical stimulation
- **Failed conservative therapy documentation:**
  - Type of therapy attempted (PT, home exercises)
  - Duration of conservative therapy
  - Outcome: Inadequate improvement in muscle strength
- Expected functional improvement from NMES
- Treatment plan and duration

**Important Notes:**

- **No prior authorization required** if meets NCD 160.12 criteria *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- WOPD required before device delivery
- Initial allowance includes: device + lead wires + 1-month supplies
- Monthly supplies: A4595 (see DM16 category)
- Most common and straightforward NMES device for home use

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - intact nerve supply and failed conservative therapy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **DVS authorization REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- Diagnosis causing disuse atrophy
- **Confirmation of intact nerve supply** (clinical exam, EMG/NCS if available)
- **Failed conservative therapy** documentation (PT, exercises, duration, outcome)
- Clinical justification for NMES therapy
- Expected functional outcomes

**Prior Approval:**

- **May be required** depending on diagnosis *(Under Review)*
- Post-surgical atrophy: Usually approved with DVS
- Stroke/neurological: May require prior approval
- Check with Medicaid for specific diagnosis requirements

**Important Notes:**

- DVS authorization mandatory
- Same clinical criteria as Medicare (NCD 160.12) generally apply
- Fiscal order must include comprehensive justification

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** DVS authorization required, fiscal order with clinical justification, intact nerve supply and failed conservative therapy documentation mandatory.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0745 - Neuromuscular stimulator for disuse atrophy"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code for muscle atrophy (M62.5x, I69.35x, G81.xx, etc.)
- [ ] **Confirmation of intact nerve supply:**
  - [ ] Clinical exam: Muscle contracts voluntarily (document strength even if weak)
  - [ ] EMG/NCS results (if performed - especially if nerve integrity questionable)
  - [ ] Muscle responds to electrical stimulation (if tested)
- [ ] **Failed conservative therapy documentation:**
  - [ ] Type: Physical therapy, home exercise program, passive ROM
  - [ ] Duration: Minimum 2-4 weeks recommended
  - [ ] Outcome: Inadequate improvement, continued muscle weakness
  - [ ] Why NMES now medically necessary
- [ ] Anatomical location of atrophy (limb, muscle groups)
- [ ] Expected functional improvement (e.g., "improve quadriceps strength for ambulation")
- [ ] Treatment duration expected
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] WOPD completed before device delivery
- [ ] NCD 160.12 criteria documented
- [ ] Confirm no prior authorization needed (if criteria clearly met)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization obtained
- [ ] Fiscal order includes all clinical justification
- [ ] Check if prior approval needed based on diagnosis
- [ ] Intact nerve supply documented clearly

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No documentation of intact nerve supply"** - Nerve integrity not documented. Fix: Must document that nerve supply is intact. Clinical exam showing voluntary muscle contraction (even if weak), or EMG/NCS confirming intact innervation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Denervation injury"** - Complete nerve damage present. Fix: E0745 NOT appropriate for denervation injury. NMES requires intact nerve to stimulate muscle. If denervation, device will not work. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No failed conservative therapy"** - Conservative measures not documented. Fix: Document trial of PT, exercises, or other conservative measures with inadequate response. Minimum 2-4 weeks recommended. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Insufficient clinical justification"** - Vague rationale. Fix: Clearly state: diagnosis causing atrophy, why muscle wasting occurred, expected functional improvement from NMES (e.g., "improve quadriceps strength to restore ambulation"). *(Under Review)*

5. **"EMG showing denervation"** - Electrical testing shows no nerve function. Fix: If EMG shows complete denervation (no motor unit potentials), NMES not appropriate. Revise treatment plan. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No WOPD"** (Medicare) - Order not completed before delivery. Fix: Complete Written Order Prior to Delivery before device dispensed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No DVS authorization"** (Medicaid) - Device ordered without DVS. Fix: Obtain DVS authorization before device delivery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

- Complete WOPD before device delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No PA required if NCD 160.12 criteria clearly met *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Initial allowance includes device + lead wires + 1-month supplies *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Order A4595 monthly supplies separately as needed *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Obtain DVS authorization before ordering *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document intact nerve supply with clinical exam findings *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Failed conservative therapy documentation comprehensive (type, duration, outcome) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order must include clear clinical justification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Check if prior approval needed for specific diagnosis (neurological vs post-surgical) *(Under Review)*
- Physiatry or neurology evaluation strengthens complex cases *(Under Review)*
