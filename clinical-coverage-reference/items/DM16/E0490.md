# E0490 - Power Source for Oral Device/Tongue NMES

## Clinical Overview

E0490 represents a specialized power source and control electronics unit for neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) of the tongue muscle. Unlike traditional NMES devices for extremities, this is a highly specialized system designed for tongue and oral muscle reeducation using a hardware remote control. The power unit provides controlled electrical stimulation to tongue muscles for conditions such as swallowing disorders (dysphagia), speech rehabilitation, or oral motor dysfunction. This is NOT a traditional NMES device for limbs - it is specifically designed for oral/tongue applications. *(Under Review)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** E0490 has LIMITED and UNCLEAR Medicare coverage. Prior authorization is REQUIRED. Coverage is determined case-by-case based on medical necessity under NCD 160.12. Verify coverage with your Medicare MAC before prescribing. NY Medicaid requires prior approval via Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005). This is a specialized device with limited coverage precedent. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**IMPORTANT:** E0490 is the power source unit. It must be used in conjunction with **E0491** (oral device/appliance). Both codes are typically required for complete therapy system.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: LIMITED - Case-by-Case Determination**

E0490 does not have established routine coverage criteria. Coverage is evaluated individually based on:

1. **Medical necessity under NCD 160.12** - Must meet neuromuscular stimulation criteria
2. **Failed conservative therapy** - Typically requires documentation of failed standard treatments
3. **Specific clinical indication** - Swallowing disorders, speech rehabilitation, or oral motor dysfunction requiring tongue muscle reeducation *(Under Review)*

**Potential Clinical Indications (Verify with MAC):**

- Dysphagia (swallowing disorders) after conservative therapy failure
- Post-stroke dysphagia requiring neuromuscular reeducation
- Speech disturbances requiring tongue muscle stimulation
- Oral motor dysfunction
- Obstructive sleep apnea (possible indication - verify coverage) *(Under Review)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Prior authorization REQUIRED** - Contact Medicare MAC before prescribing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Comprehensive clinical evaluation documenting:
  - Specific diagnosis requiring tongue NMES
  - Failed conservative treatments (swallow therapy, speech therapy, etc.)
  - Expected functional improvement from tongue stimulation
  - Treatment plan and duration
- Evaluation by specialist (speech-language pathologist, neurologist, physiatrist) recommended
- Face-to-face encounter likely required (verify with MAC)
- Standard Written Order (SWO) with detailed justification

**Important Notes:**

- Limited coverage information available - NOT routine coverage
- Must verify coverage with Medicare MAC before prescribing
- E0491 oral appliance also required for complete system
- Highly specialized indication with limited precedent
- High likelihood of denial without comprehensive documentation

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: UNKNOWN - Requires Prior Approval**

NY Medicaid coverage for E0490 is not established in routine DME policies. Coverage requires:

**Prior Approval Process:**

- Contact **Bureau of Medical Review** at **(800) 342-3005** for coverage determination *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit comprehensive clinical documentation:
  - Diagnosis requiring tongue neuromuscular stimulation
  - Failed conservative therapies with dates and outcomes
  - Specialist evaluation (SLP, neurologist, physiatrist)
  - Expected functional outcomes
  - Treatment plan with goals and duration
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber with detailed justification
- Likely requires face-to-face encounter documentation

**Important Notes:**

- Not listed in routine NY Medicaid DME manual
- Case-by-case determination required
- High-cost specialized device requiring strong justification
- E0491 oral appliance also required

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** Requires prior approval via Bureau of Medical Review with comprehensive documentation.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**IMPORTANT:** Contact payers BEFORE prescribing to verify coverage.

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0490 - Power source for oral device/tongue NMES"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code requiring tongue neuromuscular stimulation
- [ ] Comprehensive clinical evaluation documenting:
  - [ ] Specific functional deficit (dysphagia, speech disorder, etc.)
  - [ ] Severity and impact on quality of life
  - [ ] Failed conservative treatments (type, duration, outcomes)
  - [ ] Why tongue NMES medically necessary vs. alternatives
  - [ ] Expected functional improvement
- [ ] Specialist evaluation (SLP, neurologist, physiatrist) - strongly recommended
- [ ] Treatment plan with goals and duration
- [ ] E0491 oral appliance also prescribed (required for complete system)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Prior authorization requested and obtained BEFORE ordering
- [ ] Contacted Medicare MAC to verify coverage criteria
- [ ] Face-to-face encounter documented (if required)
- [ ] Comprehensive failed conservative therapy documentation

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Contacted Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005) for coverage determination
- [ ] Prior approval obtained BEFORE ordering
- [ ] Comprehensive clinical justification submitted
- [ ] Specialist evaluation documented

## Common Issues

1. **"Limited coverage information"** - Not routine coverage. Fix: Contact Medicare MAC or Medicaid Bureau of Medical Review BEFORE prescribing to verify current coverage criteria. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Prior authorization not obtained"** - Device ordered without PA. Fix: E0490 requires prior authorization from Medicare and prior approval from Medicaid. Obtain authorization BEFORE device delivery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Insufficient clinical documentation"** - Lacking justification. Fix: Provide comprehensive documentation: failed conservative therapies, specialist evaluation, functional goals, medical necessity justification. *(Under Review)*

4. **"E0491 not included"** - Power unit ordered without oral appliance. Fix: E0490 power unit requires E0491 oral appliance for complete functional system. Order both codes. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Contact Medicare MAC BEFORE prescribing to verify current coverage status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Obtain prior authorization BEFORE device delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document comprehensive failed conservative therapy (swallow therapy, speech therapy, etc.) *(Under Review)*
- Obtain specialist evaluation (SLP, neurologist, physiatrist) supporting tongue NMES need *(Under Review)*
- Provide detailed treatment plan with functional goals *(Under Review)*
- Expect potential denial - highly specialized device with limited coverage precedent *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005) BEFORE prescribing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Obtain prior approval with comprehensive clinical justification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include specialist evaluation supporting medical necessity *(Under Review)*
- Document failed conservative treatments thoroughly *(Under Review)*
- Be prepared for case-by-case determination *(Under Review)*
