# A4558 - Conductive Gel or Paste for NMES/TENS

## Clinical Overview

A4558 represents conductive gel or paste used with neuromuscular electrical stimulators (NMES) or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulators (TENS). This conductive medium ensures proper electrical transmission from the electrode to the patient's skin, reducing skin impedance and improving stimulation effectiveness. The gel/paste prevents skin irritation, provides consistent electrical contact during therapy sessions, and is essential for effective electrical stimulation therapy. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** A4558 is **NOT separately billable** to Medicare or Medicaid. This code is bundled into the A4595 monthly supply allowance. Conductive gel is included in the initial NMES device setup and monthly supply kit. **Do not attempt to bill A4558 separately** - claims will be denied as bundled/included service. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**NOT Separately Billable - Bundled Code**

A4558 is **NOT separately billable** to Medicare. This code is bundled into:
- **A4595** - Monthly electrical stimulator supply kit *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Initial NMES/TENS device setup and dispensing

Conductive gel/paste is included as part of the monthly supply allowance (A4595) and initial device dispensing. **No separate claims should be submitted for A4558.** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Coverage Tied to Underlying Device:**

Conductive gel is only covered when used with a medically necessary and covered NMES or TENS device, such as:
- **E0745** - Neuromuscular stimulator for disuse atrophy (see DM16 category)
- **E0764** - Functional electrical stimulation for spinal cord injury (see DM16 category)
- **E0731** - Form fitting conductive garment (see DM16 category)
- **E0730** - TENS device (see DM22 category) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Active NMES/TENS device order and coverage
- Medical records showing ongoing device use for covered indication
- Diagnosis supporting electrical stimulation therapy

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed separately to Medicare
- Included in A4595 monthly supply allowance
- No separate prior authorization process
- Quantity included in A4595 is sufficient for monthly therapy needs

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**NOT Separately Billable - Bundled Code**

A4558 is bundled with the monthly supply code (A4595) for NY Medicaid. Conductive gel/paste is included in:
- DVS authorization for NMES device supplies
- Monthly A4595 supply kit
- Initial device setup *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Do not submit separate claims for A4558 to NY Medicaid.** Claims will be denied as bundled service.

**Coverage Requirements:**

- Must have approved NMES/TENS device with DVS authorization
- Gel/paste included automatically with A4595 monthly supplies
- No separate fiscal order needed for A4558

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All bundling rules and requirements are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**A4558 is NOT separately prescribed or billed.** When prescribing an NMES/TENS device (E0745, E0764, E0731, E0730), conductive gel is automatically included in:

- Initial device setup
- Monthly A4595 supply kit

**For the underlying NMES/TENS device prescription, include:**
- [ ] Specific device code (E0745, E0764, E0731, or E0730)
- [ ] Diagnosis requiring electrical stimulation
- [ ] Clinical indication (disuse atrophy, spinal cord injury, pain, etc.)
- [ ] Expected duration of therapy
- [ ] Physician signature and NPI

**Note:** DME supplier will automatically include conductive gel with device and monthly supplies. Do not write separate prescription for A4558.

## Common Billing Errors

1. **"Billing A4558 separately"** - Code is bundled. Fix: Do NOT bill A4558 separately. Conductive gel is included in A4595 monthly supply code. Bill only A4595 for monthly supplies. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No active NMES/TENS device"** - Gel claimed without device. Fix: A4558 coverage requires active covered NMES/TENS device. Cannot bill supplies without approved device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Requesting separate authorization for gel"** - Unnecessary request. Fix: No separate PA or DVS authorization needed for A4558. Authorization is included with device approval and A4595 supplies. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Suppliers

**Medicare:**
- Do NOT bill A4558 separately - it will be denied *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include conductive gel automatically with A4595 monthly supply kit *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Gel cost is bundled into A4595 reimbursement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document gel provision in delivery records for compliance

**Medicaid:**
- Do NOT bill A4558 separately - bundled with A4595 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- DVS authorization for A4595 covers gel provision *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include gel with monthly supply deliveries *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Maintain delivery documentation showing gel provided
