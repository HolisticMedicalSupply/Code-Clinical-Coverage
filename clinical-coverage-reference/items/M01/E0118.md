# E0118 - Knee Walker / Knee Scooter

## Clinical Overview

E0118 represents a lower leg platform crutch substitute, commonly known as a knee walker or knee scooter. The device features a padded platform for the affected leg to rest on while the patient propels themselves with the unaffected leg. Most models include wheels for mobility.

Knee walkers are appropriate for non-weight-bearing foot/ankle conditions when the patient cannot tolerate traditional crutches due to inadequate upper body strength, balance issues, or other contraindications to standard crutch use. They provide an alternative mobility solution that doesn't require upper body weight-bearing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

**Important:** Medicare and NY Medicaid require **ADDITIONAL documentation** beyond standard crutch criteria, explaining why traditional crutches are insufficient and demonstrating safe operation capability.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED with enhanced documentation**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- **All three standard criteria PLUS:**
  1. Standard MRADL criteria met (mobility limitation affecting ADLs in home)
  2. Safe use capability
  3. Sufficient functional resolution
- **ADDITIONAL requirement:** Documentation explaining why standard crutches (E0110-E0116) insufficient
- Must demonstrate safe operation capability with knee walker

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- **Document non-weight-bearing foot/ankle status** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Explain why standard crutches inadequate:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Inadequate upper body strength for crutches
  - Balance issues preventing safe crutch use
  - Upper extremity condition preventing crutch use
  - Patient unable to tolerate axillary or forearm crutches
  - Medical contraindication to standard crutches
- **Document safe operation capability:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Patient can safely propel knee walker
  - Adequate balance with knee walker
  - Home environment suitable for knee walker use (space, flooring, doorways)

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Replacement before 5 years requires documentation

**Billing:**
- Modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), UE (used), KH, KI, KJ
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct Bill** (NO DVS or Prior Approval required)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Non-weight-bearing foot/ankle status
- Post-surgical foot/ankle procedures, foot ulcers, severe sprains, fractures
- Patients who cannot tolerate traditional crutches or have inadequate upper body strength
- **Must document why traditional crutches inadequate and safe operation capability**

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- Document non-weight-bearing status and expected duration
- **Justify why standard crutches insufficient**
- Demonstrate safe operation capability
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting non-weight-bearing need

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F3** (once every 5 years)
- Higher cost than standard crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Rental common for short-term use** with -RR modifier *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Rental vs. Purchase:**
- Short-term post-operative: typically rent (6-12 weeks) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Chronic conditions: may purchase if long-term need documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill, no DVS required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for foot/ankle condition
- [ ] **Non-weight-bearing status** and expected duration
- [ ] **Justification why standard crutches inadequate:**
  - [ ] Inadequate upper body strength (document strength assessment)
  - [ ] Balance issues preventing safe crutch use
  - [ ] Upper extremity condition preventing crutch grip
  - [ ] Patient unable to tolerate crutches (specify reason)
- [ ] **Safe operation assessment:** Patient can safely use knee walker
- [ ] Home environment suitable for knee walker (space, flooring)
- [ ] Expected duration of use
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document MRADL impairment
- [ ] Explain why standard crutches insufficient (specific reasons)
- [ ] Document safe operation capability
- [ ] Home safety assessment

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Post-operative protocol or wound care plan requiring non-weight-bearing
- [ ] Reason traditional crutches inadequate
- [ ] Length of need (determines rental vs. purchase)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Standard crutches not ruled out"** - No documentation why crutches inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Clearly state: "Standard crutches insufficient due to [inadequate upper body strength/balance issues/upper extremity condition]. Patient requires knee walker for safe non-weight-bearing mobility."

2. **"MRADL criteria not met"** - Mobility limitation not documented. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document specific ADLs impaired (toileting, bathing, dressing) due to non-weight-bearing foot/ankle status.

3. **"Safe operation not documented"** - No assessment of patient's ability to safely use knee walker. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Include: "Patient assessed and able to safely operate knee walker with good balance and unaffected leg strength. Home environment assessed - adequate space and suitable flooring."

4. **"Home environment not suitable"** - Concerns about safety in home. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Document home assessment: doorway widths, flooring type, space for maneuvering, stairs/obstacles managed.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Key documentation:** Why standard crutches insufficient + safe operation capability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Strong justifications:
  - Upper body strength assessment showing inadequacy for crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Balance deficits documented (falls with crutches, near-falls) *(Under Review)*
  - Upper extremity condition (arthritis, rotator cuff injury, carpal tunnel) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Cardiopulmonary condition limiting upper body exertion *(Under Review)*
- Document safe knee walker operation: trial successful, balance adequate, home suitable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- No DVS authorization needed - streamlined approval *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Rental recommended for short-term post-operative (6-12 weeks) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include post-operative orders specifying non-weight-bearing duration
- Document specific reason crutches inadequate (not just patient preference)

**Clinical Scenarios Favoring Knee Walker:**
- **Elderly patient** with limited upper body strength *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Bilateral upper extremity arthritis** preventing crutch grip *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Balance impairment** making crutches unsafe *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **COPD/cardiac condition** limiting upper body exertion *(Under Review)*
- **Diabetic foot ulcer** requiring prolonged non-weight-bearing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Post-surgical foot/ankle** with extended non-weight-bearing protocol (>8 weeks) *(Under Review)*
