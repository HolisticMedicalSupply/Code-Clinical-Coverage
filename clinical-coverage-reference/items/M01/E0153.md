# E0153 - Platform Attachment for Forearm Crutch

## Clinical Overview

E0153 represents a platform attachment for forearm crutches (E0110/E0111) that provides a forearm weight-bearing surface instead of requiring hand grip. The platform allows patients who cannot bear weight through their hands or wrists to use forearm crutches by distributing pressure through the forearm.

This accessory is medically necessary for patients with arthritis, fractures, nerve injuries, or neurological conditions affecting hand/wrist/elbow function who require crutch support but cannot grip standard handgrips *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

Platform attachments convert the weight-bearing point from the hand to the forearm, making crutch use possible for patients with compromised hand function.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED as accessory**

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Covered base forearm crutch must meet LCD L33733 criteria (E0110 or E0111)
- **Must document upper extremity condition preventing standard crutch grip**
- Platform attachment must be medically necessary (not for comfort/convenience) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Document why standard handgrips insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify upper extremity diagnosis preventing hand grip:
  - Arthritis affecting hands/wrists
  - Wrist/hand fractures or injuries
  - Nerve compression (carpal tunnel, ulnar nerve)
  - Neurological conditions affecting grip strength
- May be required for initial issue or as addition to existing crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency: Subject to reasonable replacement intervals based on wear *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quantity: 1 for single crutch (E0111) or 2 for pair (E0110) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Billed **EACH** (one unit per platform)

**Billing:**
- Modifiers: NU (new), AV (item furnished in conjunction with prosthetic/orthotic device) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Can be used for initial crutch issue OR replacement on existing crutches
- No prior authorization required
- POD required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED (#)** before delivery
- **NO Prior Approval needed**

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Upper extremity weakness/pain preventing hand grip
- Wrist/hand arthritis or injury requiring forearm support vs. hand grip
- Must have covered base crutch (E0110 or E0111)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order required
- **Must document diagnosis requiring forearm support**
- Upper extremity assessment showing need for platform vs. standard grip *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must be medically necessary, not comfort/convenience

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F7** (twice per year / every 6 months)
- Quantity: 1 for single crutch or 2 for pair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Billed EACH (per platform)
- Can be billed at initial crutch issue OR as replacement

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. DVS authorization required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for upper extremity condition
- [ ] **Statement explaining why standard handgrip cannot be used**
- [ ] Specify hand/wrist/forearm limitation (arthritis, fracture, weakness, nerve injury)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement
- [ ] Quantity needed (1 or 2 depending on crutch configuration)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document hand/wrist condition preventing standard grip use
- [ ] Note base crutch code (E0110 or E0111)
- [ ] Specify if for initial issue or addition to existing crutches

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Upper extremity assessment documenting need
- [ ] Diagnosis supporting platform necessity
- [ ] Base crutch information

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No upper extremity condition documented"** - Prescription does not explain why platform needed vs. standard handgrip. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Clearly document: "Patient has [arthritis/fracture/carpal tunnel] affecting [hand/wrist], preventing ability to grip standard crutch handgrip. Platform attachment medically necessary to bear weight through forearm."

2. **"Base crutch not covered"** - No covered forearm crutch (E0110/E0111) on file. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Ensure base crutch covered before ordering platform attachment. Platform cannot be billed without covered base equipment.

3. **"No DVS authorization"** (NY Medicaid) - Delivered without DVS auth. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Obtain DVS authorization before delivery.

4. **"Comfort item, not medically necessary"** - Documentation suggests convenience rather than medical necessity. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Document specific medical condition requiring platform (arthritis limiting grip strength, fracture preventing hand weight-bearing, nerve injury affecting grip).

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Key documentation:** Upper extremity condition preventing standard grip *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Strong diagnoses: wrist/hand arthritis, carpal tunnel, hand fracture, neurological conditions affecting grip
- Include grip strength assessment if available (e.g., "Patient unable to grip handgrip due to severe arthritis; grip strength 5 lbs bilaterally") *(Under Review)*
- Note whether platforms needed for initial crutch issue or being added to existing crutches

**NY Medicaid:**
- Obtain DVS authorization before delivery
- Frequency F7 allows replacement twice per year - more frequent than most accessories *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document upper extremity assessment clearly in fiscal order
- Specify which hand(s) affected and severity

**Clinical Scenarios Favoring Platform Attachment:**
- **Rheumatoid arthritis** - Hand/wrist deformities preventing grip *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Carpal tunnel syndrome** - Nerve compression limiting grip strength *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Post-surgical wrist/hand** - Recovering from fracture/surgery requiring continued lower extremity support but hand cannot grip yet *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Cerebral palsy/neurological conditions** - Limited hand function requiring forearm weight-bearing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
