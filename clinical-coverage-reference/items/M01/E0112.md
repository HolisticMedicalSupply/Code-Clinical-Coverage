# E0112 - Underarm Crutches, Wood - Pair

## Clinical Overview

E0112 represents a pair of traditional wooden axillary (underarm) crutches for temporary mobility support. These are the classic crutches with wooden construction, featuring underarm pads, handgrips, and rubber tips. They are appropriate for short-term use (typically <3 months) for conditions like fractures, post-surgical recovery, or acute injuries *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

Wooden underarm crutches require adequate upper body strength and balance to use safely. They are generally preferred for temporary situations where the lower weight and adjustability of aluminum are not critical factors.

**⚠️ Important:** For longer-term use (>3 months), consider forearm crutches (E0110/E0111) to reduce axillary pressure and risk of nerve damage *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- All three standard criteria must be met:
  1. Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
  2. Safe use capability (adequate upper body strength and balance)
  3. Sufficient functional resolution with crutch use
- Appropriate for short-term use (fractures, post-surgical)
- Patient must have adequate upper body strength to bear weight through crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- Document lower extremity condition requiring bilateral support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify weight-bearing status (non-weight-bearing, partial weight-bearing, touch-down) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Expected duration of use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document adequate upper body strength and balance *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 pair per patient (billed per pair, not individually) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Replacement before 5 years requires documentation

**Billing:**
- **Billed per pair** (do not bill E0113 x 2; use E0112 for pair)
- Modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), UE (used), KH (initial month), KI (second/third month), KJ (capped rental)
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct Bill** (NO DVS or Prior Approval required)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Temporary non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing status
- Post-surgical orthopedic recovery, lower extremity fractures/sprains/injuries requiring bilateral support
- Adequate upper body strength for axillary crutch use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- Diagnosis and expected duration required
- Weight-bearing status specification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting bilateral crutch use

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F3** (once every 5 years)
- Rental available with -RR modifier (~$0.41/day per pair)
- Quantity: 1 pair per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Rental vs. Purchase:**
- Short-term post-operative recovery: typically rent *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If Length of Need <10 months: rent *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If Length of Need ≥10 months: may purchase *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill, no DVS or prior approval required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for lower extremity condition
- [ ] Weight-bearing status (non-weight-bearing, partial weight-bearing, touch-down)
- [ ] Expected duration of use (weeks/months)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting need for bilateral support
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document MRADL impairment
- [ ] Document adequate upper body strength and balance for underarm crutch use
- [ ] Length of need

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify weight-bearing status clearly from orthopedic protocol
- [ ] Document post-surgical recovery or injury requiring bilateral crutches
- [ ] Expected duration (determines rental vs. purchase)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"MRADL criteria not met"** (Medicare) - Mobility limitation not documented as affecting daily activities. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document specific MRADLs impaired (e.g., "Patient non-weight-bearing on right lower extremity post tibial fracture repair, requiring bilateral crutch support for all ambulation including toileting, dressing, bathing").

2. **"Insufficient upper body strength"** - Documentation suggests patient cannot safely use underarm crutches. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Document upper body strength assessment. If inadequate, consider alternatives (walker, wheelchair, knee walker E0118).

3. **"Forearm crutches more appropriate"** - Long-term use where forearm style preferred to reduce axillary pressure. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** For temporary use (<3 months), E0112 appropriate. For longer-term (>3 months), consider E0110 forearm crutches.

4. **"Billed incorrectly"** - Submitted E0113 x 2 instead of E0112 for pair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Bill E0112 for a pair, not E0113 x 2.

5. **"Within 5-year RUL"** - Previous crutches provided within 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document loss, theft, or damage if replacement needed early.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Include post-operative protocol or orthopedic note specifying weight-bearing status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document expected recovery timeline (e.g., "6-8 weeks non-weight-bearing per orthopedic protocol")
- Note upper body strength adequate for crutch use (grip strength, arm strength, balance assessment) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For acute injuries: include date of injury and treatment plan

**NY Medicaid:**
- No DVS authorization needed - streamlined approval process *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify expected duration accurately for rental vs. purchase decision:
  - Post-surgical: typically 6-12 weeks (rent)
  - Acute injury: 4-8 weeks (rent)
  - Chronic condition: unusual for underarm crutches; consider forearm style
- Include post-operative orders from surgeon specifying non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Wood vs. Aluminum Decision:**
- **Use Wood (E0112) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Standard temporary use acceptable
  - Patient comfortable with traditional wood crutches
  - Cost savings important
- **Use Aluminum (E0114) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Patient needs lighter weight equipment
  - Adjustability important (aluminum typically more adjustable)
  - Long-term temporary use where durability matters
