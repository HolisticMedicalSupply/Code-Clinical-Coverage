# E0117 - Articulating Underarm Crutch with Spring Assist

## Clinical Overview

E0117 represents an advanced articulating, spring-assisted underarm crutch featuring enhanced shock absorption and dynamic articulation during ambulation. These crutches have movable joints that allow for more natural gait patterns and reduced impact forces.

**⚠️ CRITICAL COVERAGE DIFFERENCE:**
- **Medicare: NOT COVERED** - Automatically denied, do not bill
- **NY Medicaid: COVERED** - With appropriate documentation

This represents a **major difference** between payers. Medicare has determined that medical necessity for articulating crutches has not been established per LCD L33733, while NY Medicaid covers them with proper justification.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: NOT COVERED**

**Medicare Position:**
- **Medical necessity NOT established per LCD L33733**
- Claims with E0117 will be **automatically DENIED** as not reasonable and necessary
- This denial occurs **even if standard crutch criteria (MRADL, safe use, functional resolution) are met**
- Suppliers should **NOT dispense or bill** this code to Medicare beneficiaries

**Alternative for Medicare:**
- **If spring-reduction crutch needed:** Bill E0116 instead per LCD L33733 guidance
- E0116 includes shock absorber feature and is covered by Medicare
- E0116 is the appropriate code for spring-assisted or shock-absorbing crutches under Medicare

**Medicare Reimbursement:**
- **NO prior auth applicable** (code is non-covered)
- Claims submitted with E0117 are automatically denied
- No documentation will support E0117 coverage under Medicare

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**⚠️ Major Difference:** NY Medicaid COVERS E0117 while Medicare does NOT.

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct Bill** (NO DVS or Prior Approval required)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Advanced articulating/spring-assisted underarm crutch for patients requiring enhanced mobility assistance
- Conditions where articulation provides therapeutic benefit
- Enhanced shock absorption needs
- **Must document need for articulating features over standard crutches (E0112/E0114/E0116)**

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- **Must justify why articulating crutch needed vs. standard underarm crutches**
- Document specific condition benefiting from articulation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting crutch use
- Expected duration of use

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F3** (once every 5 years)
- Higher fee: ~$248.35 (significantly higher than standard crutches due to advanced features)
- Rental available with -RR modifier
- Quantity: 1 for unilateral use or 2 for bilateral need *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. COVERED with same documentation requirements.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**For Medicare Beneficiaries:**
- [ ] **Do NOT prescribe or bill E0117** - use E0116 instead if spring-reduction feature needed
- [ ] Inform patient E0117 is not covered by Medicare
- [ ] Use E0116 for shock-absorbing crutches

**For NY Medicaid Beneficiaries:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for condition requiring crutches
- [ ] **Justification for articulating crutch:** Explain why standard crutch (E0112/E0114/E0116) insufficient
- [ ] Specific therapeutic benefit from articulation feature
- [ ] Weight-bearing status
- [ ] Expected duration of use
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

**Medicare:**
1. **"Code not covered - medical necessity not established"** - ALL Medicare E0117 claims denied. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Do NOT bill E0117 to Medicare. Use E0116 instead if spring-reduction crutch needed.

**NY Medicaid:**
1. **"Standard crutch more appropriate"** - Documentation does not justify need for articulating features. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Clearly document: "Standard underarm crutches (E0112/E0114/E0116) inadequate for patient's needs due to [specific reason]. Articulating features provide [specific therapeutic benefit]."

2. **"No justification for advanced features"** - Prescription does not explain benefit of articulation. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Document specific condition requiring enhanced shock absorption or dynamic articulation (e.g., severe osteoarthritis, post-surgical requiring gentle impact, chronic pain condition benefiting from articulation).

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Do NOT bill E0117 under any circumstances** - automatic denial *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Inform Medicare beneficiaries this code is not covered
- **Alternative:** Use E0116 for spring-reduction or shock-absorbing crutches - this IS covered by Medicare
- Set patient expectations: articulating crutches would require cash payment if desired

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Document specific therapeutic benefit** of articulating features *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Compare to standard crutches: explain why E0112/E0114/E0116 insufficient
- Higher cost ($248.35) requires stronger justification than standard crutches *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include:
  - Specific diagnosis benefiting from articulation
  - Failed trial or contraindication for standard crutches *(Under Review)*
  - Expected therapeutic outcome from articulating feature *(Under Review)*

**Potential Justifications for E0117 (NY Medicaid only):**
- Severe osteoarthritis requiring minimal impact forces *(Under Review)*
- Post-surgical condition requiring gentle, dynamic ambulation support *(Under Review)*
- Chronic pain condition where standard crutch impact causes pain exacerbation *(Under Review)*
- Enhanced mobility and independence with articulating features *(Under Review)*
