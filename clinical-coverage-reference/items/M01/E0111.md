# E0111 - Forearm Crutch (Lofstrand Crutch) - Each

## Clinical Overview

E0111 represents a single forearm crutch (also called Lofstrand crutch or Canadian crutch) for unilateral support. This code is used when only one forearm crutch is medically necessary, such as for single-side injuries, hemiplegia, or as a replacement for one crutch from an existing pair.

The forearm crutch features a forearm cuff and handgrip, providing upper extremity support while distributing weight through the forearm. When only one crutch is needed, patients typically use it on the opposite side of the affected leg for optimal weight distribution and balance *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

**Specifications:** >23" height, no rotation (per NY Medicaid standards).

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- All three standard criteria must be met
- **Critical requirement:** Must document medical necessity for single crutch vs. pair (E0110)
- Appropriate for unilateral lower extremity support or single-sided injury

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- **Must justify why single crutch vs. pair:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Unilateral injury/surgery affecting one leg only
  - Hemiplegia or single-sided weakness

- Document adequate upper body strength and balance for single crutch use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 per patient (billed EACH, not per pair) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For replacement of one crutch: document reason (damage, loss, theft) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- For pair, use E0110 (do NOT bill E0111 x 2)
- Modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), UE (used), KH, KI, KJ
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- **Must document need for single vs. pair**
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting unilateral crutch use
- If replacement: document reason for replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for unilateral condition
- [ ] **Justification for single crutch:** "Unilateral [injury/weakness] affecting [right/left] lower extremity only" OR "Replacement for damaged crutch"
- [ ] Weight-bearing status for affected leg
- [ ] Expected duration of use
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document why single crutch medically necessary vs. pair
- [ ] Document adequate strength and balance for single crutch use
- [ ] Length of need

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify which leg affected (right/left)
- [ ] Document unilateral injury/surgery/weakness
- [ ] Length of need

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Pair more appropriate"** - Documentation suggests bilateral support needed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Clearly state "Unilateral injury affecting [right/left] lower extremity only. Patient requires single forearm crutch for opposite-side support." If bilateral support needed, use E0110 instead.

2. **"No justification for single vs. pair"** - Prescription does not explain why only one crutch needed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Explicitly document: "Single crutch medically necessary due to unilateral condition" or "Replacement for one damaged crutch from existing pair."

3. **"Billed incorrectly as pair"** - Submitted E0111 x 2 instead of E0110 for pair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** For pair, bill E0110 (not E0111 x 2). E0111 is for single crutch only.

4. **"Within 5-year RUL"** - Previous crutch provided within 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** For replacement before 5 years, document damage, loss, or theft with explanation.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Key phrase:** "Unilateral injury/weakness affecting [right/left] lower extremity - single forearm crutch medically necessary" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify side affected and explain contralateral crutch use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For hemiplegia: document single-sided weakness with need for unilateral support
- For replacement: "Replacement for damaged/lost crutch from existing pair; original pair provided [date]" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- No DVS authorization needed - streamlined approval *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Clearly specify unilateral condition in fiscal order
- For replacement: note which crutch (right/left) needs replacement and why *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**When to Use E0111 vs. E0110:**

**Use E0111 (single) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Strictly unilateral injury (e.g., ankle fracture one side)
- Hemiplegia requiring single-sided support
- Replacement for one damaged crutch from existing pair
- Patient has adequate balance to use single crutch safely

**Use E0110 (pair) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bilateral support needed
- Both legs affected
- Patient requires maximum stability
- Initial prescription for forearm crutches (typically prescribed as pair)
