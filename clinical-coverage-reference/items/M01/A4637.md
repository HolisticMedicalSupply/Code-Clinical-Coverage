# A4637 - Replacement Tip for Cane/Crutch/Walker

## Clinical Overview

A4637 represents a replacement tip for patient-owned canes (E0100, E0105), crutches (E0110-E0118), or walkers (E0130-E0159). Tips are safety-critical components that provide traction and stability, preventing slips and falls during ambulation.

Worn tips lose traction and can cause dangerous slipping, particularly on smooth surfaces *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Tips should be inspected regularly and replaced when tread wear is visible or when the tip shows signs of damage, cracking, or deterioration.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: DVS authorization required for WALKER tips only (NY Medicaid). Cane/crutch tips are direct bill.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED as safety-critical replacement**

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Base equipment (cane/crutch/walker) must meet LCD L33733 or L33791 criteria
- Tip must be worn or damaged affecting traction and safety
- No separate diagnosis required beyond base equipment coverage

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Document base equipment covered (specify cane/crutch/walker code)
- Document tip worn/damaged requiring replacement for safety *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No specific medical condition documentation needed

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency: Subject to reasonable replacement intervals based on wear *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quantity: Varies by equipment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*:
  - Standard cane (E0100): 1 tip
  - Quad cane (E0105): 4 tips (billed as 4 units)
  - Crutch pair (E0110): 2 tips
  - Walker (E0130/E0143): 4 tips (standard walker has 4 legs)

**Billing:**
- Billed **EACH** (per tip, not per set)
- Example: Quad cane replacement = 4 units of A4637
- Modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), UE (used)
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **For WALKER tips:** DVS authorization REQUIRED (#)
- **For CANE/CRUTCH tips:** Direct Bill (NO DVS required)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Replacement tips for patient-owned canes, crutches, or walkers
- Safety-critical replacement when existing tip worn/damaged
- No specific diagnosis beyond original walker/cane/crutch qualification

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order required
- Specify base equipment type (cane/crutch/walker)
- Document tip wear or damage affecting safety *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Fee: ~$1.87-$1.90 per tip
- **Up to 5 per year allowed**
- Quantity varies by equipment (same as Medicare)
- Original equipment fiscal order must be on file *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For walkers: walker must be <5 years old *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. DVS required for walker tips, direct bill for cane/crutch tips.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Base equipment code (E0100, E0105, E0110, E0130, etc.)
- [ ] Quantity needed (specify number of tips based on equipment)
- [ ] Reason for replacement (worn, damaged, safety concern)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document base equipment meets coverage criteria
- [ ] Note tip wear or damage

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify equipment type clearly (cane/crutch/walker)
- [ ] For walker tips: obtain DVS authorization before delivery
- [ ] For cane/crutch tips: direct bill, no DVS needed
- [ ] Document replacement need

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Base equipment not covered"** - No covered cane/crutch/walker on file. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Ensure base equipment was covered initially before billing replacement tips.

2. **"No DVS authorization"** (NY Medicaid walker tips) - Walker tips delivered without DVS auth. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Obtain DVS authorization before delivering walker tips. Cane/crutch tips do not require DVS.

3. **"Excessive quantity"** - Billed incorrect number of tips for equipment type. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Bill correct quantity: 1 for standard cane, 4 for quad cane, 2 for crutch pair, 4 for standard walker.

4. **"Exceeds annual limit"** (NY Medicaid) - More than 5 tips billed in one year. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Maximum 5 per year per NY Medicaid. Document excessive wear if higher quantity needed.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Simple safety replacement - minimal documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill correct quantity per equipment type
- Replace tips proactively when wear visible (don't wait for falls) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Remember DVS requirement difference:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Walker tips: DVS authorization REQUIRED
  - Cane/crutch tips: Direct bill, NO DVS needed
- Low cost ($1.87-$1.90/tip) - typically approved without issue *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Up to 5 per year allowed (enough for one full quad cane replacement + 1 spare)

**When Tip Replacement Indicated:**
- **Replace immediately when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Tread worn smooth (loss of traction pattern)
  - Tip cracked, split, or deteriorating
  - Rubber hardened or brittle
  - Tip damaged from impact or wear
  - Patient reports slipping during use
- **Typical replacement frequency:** *(Under Review)*
  - Heavy daily use: every 3-6 months
  - Moderate use: every 6-12 months
  - Light use: annually or as needed

**Quantity Guide by Equipment:**

| Equipment | Tips Needed | Units to Bill |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Standard cane (E0100) | 1 | 1 |
| Quad cane (E0105) | 4 | 4 |
| Forearm crutches, pair (E0110) | 2 | 2 |
| Forearm crutch, each (E0111) | 1 | 1 |
| Underarm crutches, pair (E0112/E0114) | 2 | 2 |
| Walker, standard (E0130/E0143) | 4 | 4 |
