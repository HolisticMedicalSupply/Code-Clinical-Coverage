# E0105 - Quad Cane / Multi-Point Cane

## Clinical Overview

E0105 represents a quad (four-point) or three-prong cane for moderate balance impairment requiring greater stability than a standard single-point cane (E0100). The wider base provides increased stability and weight-bearing capacity, making it appropriate for patients with hemiplegia, severe arthritis, neurological conditions, or significant balance deficits.

The multi-point base remains on the ground during ambulation, providing continuous support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Quad canes are particularly useful for patients who have failed trials with standard canes or have medical conditions requiring enhanced stability.

**Specifications:** >31" height, no rotation (per NY Medicaid standards).

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- **All three standard criteria must be met:**
  1. Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
  2. Safe use capability
  3. Sufficient functional resolution with quad cane use
- **Additional requirement:** Appropriate when standard cane (E0100) insufficient for patient's mobility needs

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- **Must document why standard single-point cane is insufficient** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify need for greater stability/weight-bearing support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific MRADL limitations
- Document patient can safely use quad cane despite increased base width *(Under Review)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Replacement before 5 years requires documentation of loss, theft, or damage

**Billing:**
- Modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), UE (used), KH (initial month), KI (second/third month), KJ (capped rental)
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required
- **Do NOT use E1399 for heavy-duty versions** - use E0105 regardless of weight capacity

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED (#)** before delivery
- **NO Prior Approval needed**
- Authorization valid 180 days *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Clinical Requirements:**
- More significant balance impairment than standard cane
- Qualifying conditions include hemiplegia, severe arthritis, neurological conditions
- Must document need for greater stability/weight-bearing support
- Specifications: >31" height, no rotation

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Original signed fiscal order required
- **Must document standard cane insufficient** for patient's needs
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting need for enhanced stability
- Specify balance impairment severity or weight-bearing needs

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F4** (once every 3 years)
- Fee: ~$18.75-$58.26 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Rental available with -RR modifier (~$0.36/day)
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. DVS authorization required before delivery.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting moderate balance impairment
- [ ] Statement of MRADL impairment
- [ ] **Justification for quad cane vs. standard cane** (e.g., "Standard cane insufficient for patient's stability needs")
- [ ] Medical necessity documenting need for greater stability or weight-bearing support
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document why E0100 (standard cane) inadequate
- [ ] Document safe use capability with wider base
- [ ] Length of need

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specific statement: "Standard cane insufficient for patient's stability needs"
- [ ] Document hemiplegia, severe arthritis, neurological condition, or specific balance deficit
- [ ] Length of need

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Standard cane not ruled out"** - Documentation does not explain why quad cane needed vs. standard single-point cane. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Explicitly state "Standard single-point cane (E0100) insufficient for patient's stability needs due to [hemiplegia/severe balance impairment/neurological condition]. Quad cane required for safe ambulation."

2. **"MRADL criteria not met"** (Medicare) - Mobility limitation not documented as affecting daily activities in home. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document specific MRADLs impaired with focus on safety concern and fall risk without quad cane support.

3. **"Patient can use walker"** - Documentation suggests patient needs bilateral support, making walker more appropriate. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** If patient requires bilateral support, consider E0130/E0143 walker instead. If unilateral support sufficient with enhanced stability, document this clearly.

4. **"No DVS authorization"** (NY Medicaid) - Delivered without DVS auth. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Obtain DVS authorization before delivery.

5. **"Within 5-year RUL"** (Medicare) - Previous quad cane provided within 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document loss, theft, or irreparable damage if replacement needed early.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Key phrase:** "Standard single-point cane insufficient for patient's stability needs" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify condition requiring quad cane: hemiplegia (strongest justification), severe arthritis with significant weight-bearing need, Parkinson's disease with balance impairment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document fall history with standard cane if applicable *(Under Review)*
- Note that patient can safely maneuver wider base through home environment *(Under Review)*
- Do NOT bill E1399 for heavy-duty quad canes - always use E0105

**NY Medicaid:**
- Obtain DVS authorization before delivery
- Use specific diagnoses: hemiplegia (I69.x), severe arthritis (M16.x, M17.x), neurological conditions (G20, G81.x)
- Document standard cane trial if attempted and failed *(Under Review)*
- Specify need for greater stability or weight-bearing support in fiscal order

**Clinical Scenarios Favoring E0105:**
- **Hemiplegia post-stroke** - Most common and well-accepted indication *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Severe osteoarthritis** - Knee or hip requiring significant weight offloading *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Parkinson's disease** - Balance and postural instability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **History of falls with standard cane** - Documented need for enhanced stability *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0100** - Standard single-point cane (for mild balance impairment)
- **A4636** - Replacement handgrip for cane
- **A4637** - Replacement tip for cane (each tip; quad cane has 4 tips requiring 4 units) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0130/E0143** - Walkers (for patients requiring bilateral support)
- **E0110/E0111** - Forearm crutches (for more significant unilateral or bilateral support needs)
