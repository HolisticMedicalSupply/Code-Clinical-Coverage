# E0113 - Underarm Crutch, Wood - Each

## Clinical Overview

E0113 represents a single wooden underarm (axillary) crutch for unilateral support. This code is used when only one underarm crutch is medically necessary, such as for single-side injuries or as a replacement for one damaged/lost crutch from an existing pair.

The wooden underarm crutch features an underarm pad, handgrip, and rubber tip. It's appropriate for temporary, short-term use when bilateral support is not required.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- All three standard criteria must be met
- **Critical requirement:** Must document medical necessity for single crutch vs. pair (E0112)
- Appropriate for unilateral lower extremity support or single-sided injury

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- **Must justify why single crutch vs. pair:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Unilateral injury/surgery affecting one leg only
  - Single-sided post-operative care
  - Replacement for one damaged/lost crutch from existing pair
- Document adequate upper body strength and balance for single crutch use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 per patient (billed EACH, not per pair) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Billing:**
- **Billed EACH** (one unit = one crutch)
- For pair, use E0112 (do NOT bill E0113 x 2)
- Modifiers: NU, RR, UE, KH, KI, KJ
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct Bill** (NO DVS or Prior Approval required)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Unilateral lower extremity support
- Single-sided injury or post-operative care requiring one crutch only
- Adequate strength and balance for single crutch use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- **Must document need for single vs. pair**
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting unilateral crutch use

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F3** (once every 5 years)
- Rental available with -RR modifier
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill, no DVS or prior approval required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for unilateral condition
- [ ] **Justification for single crutch:** "Unilateral [injury/surgery] affecting [right/left] lower extremity only" OR "Replacement for damaged crutch"
- [ ] Weight-bearing status for affected leg
- [ ] Expected duration of use
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document why single crutch medically necessary vs. pair
- [ ] Length of need

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify which leg affected (right/left)
- [ ] Document unilateral injury/surgery
- [ ] Length of need

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Pair more appropriate"** - Documentation suggests bilateral support needed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Clearly state "Unilateral injury affecting [right/left] lower extremity only. Patient requires single underarm crutch for support." If bilateral support needed, use E0112 instead.

2. **"No justification for single vs. pair"** - Prescription does not explain why only one crutch needed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Explicitly document: "Single crutch medically necessary due to unilateral condition" or "Replacement for one damaged crutch from existing pair."

3. **"Billed incorrectly as pair"** - Submitted E0113 x 2 instead of E0112 for pair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** For pair, bill E0112 (not E0113 x 2). E0113 is for single crutch only.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Key phrase:** "Unilateral injury affecting [right/left] lower extremity - single underarm crutch medically necessary" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify side affected
- For replacement: "Replacement for damaged/lost crutch from existing pair; original pair provided [date]" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- No DVS authorization needed - streamlined approval *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Clearly specify unilateral condition in fiscal order

**When to Use E0113 vs. E0112:**

**Use E0113 (single) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Strictly unilateral injury (e.g., ankle sprain one side)
- Single-sided post-operative care
- Replacement for one damaged crutch from existing pair
- Patient has adequate balance to use single crutch safely

**Use E0112 (pair) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bilateral support needed
- Both legs affected or compromised
- Patient requires maximum stability
- Initial prescription (typically prescribed as pair)
