# E0116 - Underarm Crutch, Aluminum - Each

## Clinical Overview

E0116 represents a single non-wood (typically aluminum) underarm crutch for unilateral support. This code is used when only one aluminum crutch is medically necessary or as a replacement for one damaged/lost crutch from an existing pair.

E0116 may include a shock absorber feature for impact reduction. **Important:** If a shock absorber or spring-reduction feature is present, use E0116 - do NOT use E0117, per Medicare LCD L33733 guidance. The shock absorber feature is included in the base E0116 code and is not separately billable.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- All three standard criteria must be met
- **Critical requirement:** Must document medical necessity for single crutch vs. pair (E0114)
- Appropriate for unilateral lower extremity support

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- **Must justify why single crutch vs. pair:**
  - Unilateral injury/surgery affecting one leg only
  - Single-sided post-operative care
  - Replacement for one damaged/lost crutch from existing pair
- Document adequate upper body strength and balance *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Shock Absorber Feature:**
- Shock absorber feature **included in base code** (not additional charge)
- For crutches with spring-reduction or shock absorption: **use E0116, NOT E0117**
- E0117 (articulating crutch) is NOT COVERED by Medicare - use E0116 for spring-reduction crutches per LCD L33733

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 per patient (billed EACH, not per pair) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Billing:**
- **Billed EACH** (one unit = one crutch)
- For pair, use E0114 (do NOT bill E0116 x 2)
- Modifiers: NU, RR, UE, KH, KI, KJ
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct Bill** (NO DVS or Prior Approval required)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Unilateral lower extremity support
- Single-side injury or weakness
- May include shock absorber feature for conditions where impact reduction beneficial

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- **Must document need for single vs. pair**
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting unilateral crutch use

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F3** (once every 5 years)

- Rental available with -RR modifier
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for unilateral condition
- [ ] **Justification for single crutch:** "Unilateral [injury/surgery] affecting [right/left] lower extremity" OR "Replacement for damaged crutch"
- [ ] Weight-bearing status for affected leg
- [ ] Expected duration of use
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document why single crutch medically necessary vs. pair
- [ ] If shock absorber present: use E0116 (NOT E0117)
- [ ] Length of need

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify which leg affected (right/left)
- [ ] Document unilateral condition
- [ ] Length of need

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Pair more appropriate"** - Documentation suggests bilateral support needed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Clearly state "Unilateral injury affecting [right/left] lower extremity only." If bilateral support needed, use E0114 instead.

2. **"Billed E0117 instead"** - Submitted E0117 for spring-reduction crutch. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** **Critical:** Use E0116 for ANY crutch with shock absorber or spring-reduction feature. E0117 is NOT COVERED by Medicare.

3. **"Billed incorrectly as pair"** - Submitted E0116 x 2 instead of E0114 for pair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** For pair, bill E0114 (not E0116 x 2). E0116 is for single crutch only.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Critical billing guidance:** For spring-reduction or shock-absorbing crutches, use E0116 (NOT E0117) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- E0117 will be DENIED by Medicare - use E0116 instead per LCD L33733
- Shock absorber is included in E0116 - do not bill separately
- Document unilateral condition clearly

**NY Medicaid:**
- No DVS authorization needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Clearly specify unilateral condition in fiscal order
- Shock absorber feature may be included for conditions where impact reduction beneficial

**When to Use E0116 vs. E0114:**

**Use E0116 (single) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Unilateral injury affecting one leg
- Single-sided post-operative care
- Replacement for one damaged crutch from existing pair
- Patient has adequate balance for single crutch

**Use E0114 (pair) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bilateral support needed
- Both legs affected
- Initial prescription (typically prescribed as pair)

**⚠️ Critical: E0117 vs. E0116**
- **E0117 (articulating/spring-assisted crutch):** NOT COVERED by Medicare
- **E0116 with shock absorber:** COVERED by Medicare
- **For any spring-reduction crutch: use E0116, NOT E0117**

- **E0113** - Underarm crutch, wood, each
- **E0112** - Underarm crutches, wood, pair
