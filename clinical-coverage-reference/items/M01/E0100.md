# E0100 - Standard Single-Point Cane

## Clinical Overview

E0100 represents a standard single-point cane for mild to moderate balance impairment. This is the most basic ambulatory assistive device, appropriate for patients who require minimal support for balance and stability. The cane includes all materials (wood, aluminum, etc.), may be adjustable or fixed height, and comes with a tip for safety and traction.

To qualify for coverage, patients must meet all three criteria from Medicare LCD L33733 (MRADL criteria): **(1)** mobility limitation significantly impairing Mobility-Related Activities of Daily Living (MRADLs - toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing) in the home, **(2)** safe use capability, and **(3)** sufficient functional resolution.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- **Criterion 1:** Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- **Criterion 2:** Capability to safely use the cane (adequate cognitive function, upper body strength, balance with cane)
- **Criterion 3:** Sufficient functional resolution with cane use (improved mobility and safety vs. no cane)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- Prescription now supports medical necessity (Policy Article A55426, effective 9/26/2024, retroactive to 1/1/2024) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific MRADL limitations *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document patient can safely use cane *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Replacement before 5 years requires documentation of loss, theft, or irreparable damage *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Billing:**
- Modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), UE (used), KH (initial month), KI (second/third month), KJ (capped rental)
- 5-year RUL (Reasonable Useful Lifetime)
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED (#)** before delivery
- **NO Prior Approval needed**
- Authorization valid 180 days *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility impairment requiring minimal ambulatory support for balance
- No specific ICD-10 codes mandated but medical necessity must document balance issues, weakness, or support need
- Same functional criteria as Medicare: MRADL impairment, safe use, functional benefit *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Original signed fiscal order required
- Must document balance issues, weakness, or mobility support need
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting mobility limitation

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F4** (once every 3 years)
- Fee: ~$12-$25.43 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Rental available with -RR modifier (~$0.24/day)
- Quantity: 1 per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. DVS authorization required before delivery.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting mobility limitation
- [ ] Statement of MRADL impairment (specify which activities affected: toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting balance or support need
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document safe use capability (cognitive status, upper body strength adequate)
- [ ] Document functional improvement expected with cane use
- [ ] Length of need: typically 99 months (lifetime) for chronic conditions

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specific statement of balance issues or weakness
- [ ] Length of need
- [ ] Prescriber must be enrolled NY Medicaid provider

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"MRADL criteria not met"** (Medicare) - Medical record does not document mobility limitation affecting daily activities in home. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document specific MRADLs impaired (e.g., "Patient unable to safely ambulate to bathroom without support, causing toileting difficulties and fall risk").

2. **"Patient can ambulate safely without cane"** - Documentation shows patient ambulatory without assistive device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document specific balance deficits, fall history, or weakness requiring cane for safe mobility.

3. **"No DVS authorization"** (NY Medicaid) - Claim submitted before DVS authorization obtained. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Obtain DVS authorization before delivery. Do not deliver equipment without active DVS auth.

4. **"Within 5-year RUL"** (Medicare) - Previous cane provided within past 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document loss, theft, or irreparable damage if replacement needed before 5 years.

5. **"Quad cane more appropriate"** - Patient condition warrants E0105 quad cane for greater stability. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** If patient needs more stability than single-point cane provides, prescribe E0105 instead with documentation of need for multi-point base.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Use the 2024 prescription update to your advantage: prescription now supports medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Be specific about which MRADLs are impaired (list by name: toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing)
- Document safe use: patient has cognitive ability to use cane correctly and upper body strength to bear weight through cane *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Note functional improvement: specify how cane improves mobility and reduces fall risk *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Obtain DVS authorization before delivery to avoid payment denial
- Document balance issues clearly in fiscal order
- Include specific diagnosis (ICD-10) supporting mobility limitation
- Original signed fiscal order required - electronic signatures must comply with NY Medicaid requirements *(Under Review)*

**When to Use E0105 Instead:**
- Patient has moderate to severe balance impairment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Single-point cane provides insufficient stability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient history of falls despite using single-point cane *(Under Review)*
- Hemiplegia or significant unilateral weakness *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Related Codes

- **E0105** - Quad or three-prong cane (for moderate balance impairment requiring greater stability)
- **A4636** - Replacement handgrip for cane
- **A4637** - Replacement tip for cane
- **E0130** - Walker, rigid pick-up (for more severe mobility limitation)
- **E0143** - Walker, folding wheeled (for patients requiring bilateral support)
