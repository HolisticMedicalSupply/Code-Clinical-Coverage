# E0114 - Underarm Crutches, Aluminum - Pair

## Clinical Overview

E0114 represents a pair of non-wood (typically aluminum) underarm (axillary) crutches for temporary mobility support. Aluminum crutches offer the same clinical function as wooden crutches (E0112) but are lighter weight and typically more adjustable, making them often preferred by patients and clinicians.

Aluminum underarm crutches feature underarm pads, handgrips, and rubber tips. They are appropriate for short to moderate-term use for fractures, post-surgical recovery, or acute injuries. The lighter weight reduces fatigue during use and the adjustability allows for more precise fitting *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- All three standard criteria must be met (same as E0112):
  1. Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
  2. Safe use capability (adequate upper body strength and balance)
  3. Sufficient functional resolution with crutch use
- **Same clinical indications as E0112 wooden crutches**
- Material choice (aluminum vs. wood) is not a medical necessity determination *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- **Same documentation as E0112** - material choice does not require special justification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document lower extremity condition requiring bilateral support
- Specify weight-bearing status
- Expected duration of use
- Document adequate upper body strength and balance

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 pair per patient (billed per pair, not individually) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Billing:**
- **Billed per pair** (do not bill E0116 x 2; use E0114 for pair)
- Modifiers: NU, RR, UE, KH, KI, KJ
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct Bill** (NO DVS or Prior Approval required)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0112 wooden crutches
- May be preferred for patients needing lighter equipment or long-term temporary use where aluminum more durable

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- Same documentation requirements as E0112
- No special justification needed for aluminum vs. wood *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F3** (once every 5 years)
- Fee: ~$23.38-$50.91 per pair (higher than wood due to material cost)
- Rental available with -RR modifier
- Quantity: 1 pair per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill, no DVS required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for lower extremity condition
- [ ] Weight-bearing status (non-weight-bearing, partial weight-bearing, touch-down)
- [ ] Expected duration of use (weeks/months)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting need for bilateral support
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document MRADL impairment
- [ ] Document adequate upper body strength and balance
- [ ] Length of need
- [ ] Material preference (aluminum) optional - not medically necessary distinction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify weight-bearing status from orthopedic protocol
- [ ] Document post-surgical recovery or injury
- [ ] Expected duration

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"MRADL criteria not met"** (Medicare) - Same as E0112. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document specific MRADLs impaired with lower extremity condition.

2. **"Wood crutches more appropriate"** - Rarely denied for material choice, but could occur if deemed cost issue. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Aluminum vs. wood is typically not a medical necessity distinction. Both cover same clinical indications. Material choice is usually patient/provider preference.

3. **"Billed incorrectly"** - Submitted E0116 x 2 instead of E0114 for pair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Bill E0114 for a pair, not E0116 x 2.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- No special justification needed for aluminum vs. wood *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Same documentation requirements as E0112 wooden crutches
- Material choice typically based on patient preference, availability, or provider standard *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- No DVS authorization needed - streamlined approval *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Higher cost than wood ($23.38-$50.91 vs. lower wood cost) but typically approved without issue *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Same rental vs. purchase guidelines as E0112

**Aluminum vs. Wood Decision Factors:**

**Aluminum Advantages (E0114):** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Lighter weight (easier for patient to manage, less fatigue)
- More adjustable (precise height fitting)
- More durable for longer temporary use
- Corrosion resistant
- Modern standard in most facilities

**Wood Advantages (E0112):** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Lower cost
- Traditional familiarity for some patients
- Adequate for short-term standard use

**Most Common Choice:** Aluminum (E0114) is more commonly prescribed in modern practice due to weight and adjustability advantages *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.
