# E0110 - Forearm Crutches (Lofstrand Crutches) - Pair

## Clinical Overview

E0110 represents a pair of forearm crutches, also known as Lofstrand crutches or Canadian crutches. These crutches feature a forearm cuff that encircles the forearm and a handgrip, providing bilateral upper extremity support while distributing weight through the forearms rather than the axillae (armpits).

Forearm crutches are preferred over underarm crutches for longer-term use because they produce less axillary pressure, reducing the risk of nerve damage and providing greater mobility and independence *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. They require adequate upper body strength but offer superior maneuverability once mastered.

**Specifications:** >23" height, no rotation (per NY Medicaid standards).

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Clinical Requirements (LCD L33733):**
- **All three standard criteria:**
  1. Mobility limitation significantly impairing MRADLs in home
  2. Safe use capability (adequate upper body strength and balance)
  3. Sufficient functional resolution with forearm crutch use
- Appropriate for longer-term use where axillary pressure from underarm crutches would be problematic *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- POD (Proof of Delivery) required
- Document lower extremity condition requiring bilateral support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document adequate upper body strength for forearm crutch use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify expected duration of use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency limit: Once every 5 years (reasonable useful lifetime)
- Quantity: 1 pair per patient (billed per pair, not individually) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Replacement before 5 years requires documentation

**Billing:**
- **Billed per pair** (do not bill E0111 x 2; use E0110 for pair)
- Modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), UE (used), KH (initial month), KI (second/third month), KJ (capped rental)
- 5-year RUL
- No prior authorization required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct Bill** (NO DVS or Prior Approval required)
- No authorization wait time - can deliver immediately with fiscal order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Lower extremity injury/surgery requiring non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing
- Long-term mobility needs
- Conditions where upper body strength adequate but lower extremity support needed
- Specifications: >23" height, no rotation

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from authorized practitioner required
- Document lower extremity condition and weight-bearing status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting bilateral crutch use
- Expected duration of use (for rental vs. purchase decision) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency code: **F3** (once every 5 years)
- Fee: ~$58.93/pair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Rental available with -RR modifier
- Quantity: 1 pair per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Rental vs. Purchase:**
- If Length of Need <10 months: must rent initially *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If Length of Need â‰¥10 months: may rent or purchase *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill, no DVS or prior approval required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for lower extremity condition
- [ ] Statement of weight-bearing status (non-weight-bearing, partial weight-bearing, touch-down weight-bearing)
- [ ] Medical necessity documenting need for bilateral upper extremity support
- [ ] Expected duration of use (weeks/months)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document MRADL impairment
- [ ] Document adequate upper body strength for forearm crutch use
- [ ] Length of need

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify weight-bearing status clearly
- [ ] Document lower extremity injury/surgery requiring crutches
- [ ] Length of need (determines rental vs. purchase)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"MRADL criteria not met"** (Medicare) - Mobility limitation not documented as affecting daily activities. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document specific MRADLs impaired (e.g., "Patient unable to bear weight on left lower extremity, requiring bilateral crutch support for all toileting, dressing, and bathing activities").

2. **"Insufficient upper body strength"** - Documentation suggests patient cannot safely use forearm crutches. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Document upper body strength assessment. If inadequate, consider alternative (walker, wheelchair, knee walker E0118).

3. **"Billed incorrectly"** - Submitted E0111 x 2 instead of E0110 for pair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Bill E0110 for a pair, not E0111 x 2.

4. **"Within 5-year RUL"** (Medicare) - Previous forearm crutches provided within 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Document loss, theft, or damage if replacement needed early.

5. **"Underarm crutches more appropriate"** - Short-term use where underarm crutches sufficient. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** If temporary use (<3 months), E0112/E0114 may be more appropriate. If longer-term or patient has axillary discomfort, document need for forearm style.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Emphasize longer-term need if applicable (>3 months) to justify forearm vs. underarm style *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document upper body strength adequate for forearm crutch use (grip strength, arm strength, balance) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For chronic conditions (cerebral palsy, permanent disability), note lifetime need
- Include weight-bearing orders from orthopedic surgeon or physiatrist *(Under Review)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- No DVS authorization needed - streamlined approval process *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify length of need accurately for rental vs. purchase decision:
  - Post-surgical recovery: typically 6-12 weeks (rent)
  - Chronic condition: 12+ months or lifetime (purchase may be cost-effective)
- Include post-operative protocol specifying non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Forearm vs. Underarm Decision Factors:**
- **Use Forearm (E0110) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Long-term use expected (>3 months)
  - Patient has history of axillary discomfort with underarm crutches
  - Patient needs greater mobility and independence
  - Permanent condition requiring ongoing crutch use
- **Use Underarm (E0112/E0114) when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Short-term use (<3 months)
  - Patient unfamiliar with forearm crutches and learning curve problematic
  - Temporary post-operative recovery
