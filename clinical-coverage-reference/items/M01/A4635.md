# A4635 - Replacement Underarm Pad for Crutches

## Clinical Overview

A4635 represents a replacement underarm pad for patient-owned underarm crutches (E0112-E0117). The underarm pad is a critical component that provides cushioning and comfort at the axillary (armpit) area where the crutch contacts the body.

Worn or damaged underarm pads should be replaced promptly to maintain comfort and safety. Deteriorated pads can cause skin irritation, discomfort, and may increase risk of axillary nerve compression or damage *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: COVERED as replacement supply**

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Base crutch equipment (E0112-E0117) must meet LCD L33733 criteria
- Underarm pad must be worn, damaged, or medically necessary to replace
- No specific diagnosis required - part of covered crutch system meeting MRADL criteria

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Document base crutch equipment covered (specify crutch code: E0112, E0113, E0114, E0116, E0117)
- Document wear or damage requiring replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No specific medical condition documentation needed beyond original crutch qualification

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Frequency: Subject to 5-year RUL of base crutch *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quantity: Varies by crutch configuration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*:

  - Pair of crutches (E0112, E0114): 2 pads (billed as 2 units)
- Reasonable replacement intervals based on wear *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Billing:**
- Billed **EACH** (per pad, not per pair)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order required
- Note base crutch equipment type (E0112, E0113, E0114, E0116, E0117)
- Reason for replacement: worn, damaged, hygiene concern *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Base crutch equipment code (E0112, E0113, E0114, E0116, E0117)
- [ ] Reason for replacement (worn, damaged, hygiene)
- [ ] Quantity needed (1 for single crutch, 2 for pair)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document base crutch meets coverage criteria
- [ ] Note pad wear or damage

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify which crutch equipment pad is for
- [ ] Document replacement need

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Base crutch not covered"** - No covered underarm crutch on file for patient. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Ensure base crutch equipment (E0112-E0117) was covered initially before billing replacement pad.

2. **"Excessive replacement frequency"** - Multiple pad replacements in short timeframe without justification. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Document reason for frequent replacement (heavy use, damage, skin sensitivity requiring hygiene replacement).

3. **"No prescription"** - Pad billed without SWO or fiscal order. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Obtain prescription before providing replacement pad.

4. **"Incorrect quantity"** - Billed wrong number of pads for crutch configuration. *(Under Review)*

**Fix:** Bill correct quantity: 1 for single crutch, 2 for pair.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Simple replacement code - minimal documentation needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Note base crutch code in prescription
- Document wear/damage if questioned
- Typically approved without issue for reasonable replacement intervals *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Direct bill - no authorization delays *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Low cost item (~$2.83-$6.27/pad) - minimal scrutiny *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Ensure fiscal order on file with original crutch information

**When Underarm Pad Replacement Indicated:**
- **Replace immediately when:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Pad compressed, flattened, or no longer providing cushioning
  - Fabric torn, cracked, or deteriorating
  - Padding separation from frame
  - Visible wear causing discomfort
  - Hygiene concerns (staining, odor, contamination)
  - Patient reports axillary discomfort or skin irritation
- **Typical replacement frequency:** *(Under Review)*
  - Heavy daily use: every 3-6 months
  - Moderate use: every 6-12 months
  - Hygiene replacement: as needed for cleanliness
  - Long-term crutch users: proactive replacement before complete wear

**Safety Note:**
Worn underarm pads increase risk of axillary nerve compression and damage *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Weight should be borne through the hands, not the armpits, but worn pads may lead to improper technique. Replace proactively to maintain safety and comfort.
