# K0554 - DISCONTINUED: Therapeutic CGM Receiver

## CRITICAL NOTICE: CODE DISCONTINUED

**K0554 was DISCONTINUED effective January 1, 2023.**

**✅ CURRENT CODE TO USE: E2103**

All claims for K0554 submitted after January 1, 2023 will be **DENIED**.

Medicare crosswalked K0554 to **E2103** (Non-adjunctive, non-implanted continuous glucose monitor or receiver).

**Suppliers must use E2103 for all therapeutic CGM receiver claims.**

## Code Transition Information

**Discontinuation Date:** January 1, 2023 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Replacement Code:** E2103 - Non-adjunctive (therapeutic) CGM receiver *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Why the Change:** Medicare standardized CGM coding by transitioning K-codes to E-codes for improved claims processing and coverage consistency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Historical Coverage (For Reference Only)

### Medicare (Historical - No Longer Applicable)

K0554 was previously used for dedicated receivers (monitors) used with therapeutic continuous glucose monitor systems. These receivers display real-time glucose data and replace standard blood glucose monitoring.

**Current code:** Use **E2103** instead.

### NY Medicaid (Historical - No Longer Applicable)

K0554 was previously used for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes patients requiring therapeutic CGM that replaces standard BGM for treatment decisions. Coverage required:
- Gestational diabetes OR Type 1/2 with insulin treatment/pump
- Provider with diabetes experience
- Compliant data review visits
- Patient ability to respond to alerts

Frequency: Once every 3 years typically.

**Current code:** Use **E2103** (and note: Dexcom/Freestyle CGMs available through pharmacy only effective 6/3/24).

## Action Items for Healthcare Providers

**If you are trying to order a therapeutic CGM receiver:**

1. **Use code E2103** - Do NOT use K0554
2. Order supplies using A4239 (not K0553)
3. Follow current coverage criteria for therapeutic CGM (See E2103 documentation)
4. **NY Medicaid:** For Dexcom/Freestyle, route to pharmacy (not DME) effective 6/3/24
5. Ensure all documentation references current codes, not discontinued K-codes

**For Medicare Claims:**
- K0554 claims after 1/1/2023: **DENIED**
- Use E2103 for all new claims
- Include CG modifier
- Follow current therapeutic CGM LCD requirements
- SWO with WOPD required before delivery

**For Medicaid Claims:**
- Transition to E2103 for receiver
- **CRITICAL:** Dexcom/Freestyle CGMs available through Preferred Diabetic Supply Program (pharmacy only) effective 6/3/24
- DME providers cannot supply PDSP-covered CGM products after 6/3/24
- Prior authorizations from before 6/3/24 honored through expiration
