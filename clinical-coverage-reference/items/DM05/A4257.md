## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Reason for Non-Coverage:**
- Laser devices not proven more effective than conventional lancet methods
- Conventional spring-powered lancet devices (A4258) are the standard of care
- Claims submitted for A4257 will be denied as not reasonable and necessary

**Medicare-Covered Alternative:**
- **A4258** - Spring-powered lancet device (covered)
- **A4259** - Lancets for conventional devices (covered)
