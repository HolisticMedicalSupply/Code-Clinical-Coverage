2. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before authorization. Fix: Supplier must obtain DVS authorization before delivery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Missing CG modifier"** (Medicare) - CG modifier not included. Fix: Always include CG modifier when billing CGM supplies. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Quantity exceeded"** (Medicare) - More than 3 units per 90 days. Fix: Maximum 3 units (3 months supply) per 90 days. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - More than 1 unit per month. Fix: Limit to 1 unit per month (F9 frequency). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"6-month visit not documented"** (Medicare) - Missing required face-to-face visit. Fix: Document initial visit within 6 months prior and schedule ongoing 6-month visits. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No CGM receiver"** - Patient doesn't have covered E2103 receiver. Fix: Ensure therapeutic CGM receiver (E2103) is covered before ordering supplies. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Standard BGM supplies billed"** - A4253 or A4259 billed with A4239. Fix: Cannot bill standard BGM supplies with therapeutic CGM - CGM replaces fingerstick testing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

9. **"Not on PDAC list"** (Medicare) - Supplies not on Product Classification List. Fix: Verify supplies are PDAC-listed before ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
