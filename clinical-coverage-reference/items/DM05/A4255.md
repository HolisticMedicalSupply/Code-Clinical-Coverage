# A4255 - Glucose Monitor Platforms/Chips

## Clinical Overview

A4255 represents platforms or chips for home blood glucose monitors (50 per box). These are specialized testing accessories used with specific glucose monitor models that utilize platform/chip technology for blood sample application and testing. Some patients require platforms as assistive devices when physical limitations (arthritis, limited dexterity, visual impairment) make standard test strip handling difficult. The patient must own a glucose monitor that specifically requires platform/chip technology. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NOTE FOR NY MEDICAID:** Not specifically listed in current manuals. Likely considered standard BGM supply. Verify coverage with Bureau of Medical Review (800) 342-3005 before prescribing. *(Under Review)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Diabetes mellitus requiring glucose monitoring
- Patient owns specific glucose monitor that uses platform/chip technology for testing
- May be needed as assistive device for patients with dexterity/visual limitations

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim
- Covered when glucose monitor covered
- Beneficiary must own monitor requiring platforms
- Document monitor ownership (E0607, E2100, E2101, E2102, E2103, E2104)
- If for dexterity assistance: Document physical limitations

**Important Notes:**
- Not all glucose monitors use platform/chip technology *(Under Review)*
- Verify patient's specific monitor model requires platforms *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May function as assistive technology for patients with arthritis or limited dexterity *(Under Review)*
- No separate documentation needed if glucose monitor already covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**NOTICE: Coverage Status Unclear**

**A4255 is NOT specifically listed in current NY Medicaid manuals.** It is likely considered a standard blood glucose monitor supply if medically necessary, but confirmation is needed. *(Under Review)*

**Action Required:**
- **Verify coverage with Bureau of Medical Review at (800) 342-3005 BEFORE prescribing**
- Obtain specific billing guidance if covered
- Determine if prior authorization required
- Confirm frequency and quantity limits

**If coverage is confirmed:**
- Document patient owns monitor requiring platform technology
- If assistive device use: Document physical limitations (arthritis, limited dexterity, visual impairment)
- Obtain specific billing instructions from NY Medicaid

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage status identical to Nassau County.** Not specifically listed in manuals. Verify coverage with Bureau of Medical Review before prescribing.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "A4255 - Platforms for blood glucose monitor, 50 per box"
- [ ] ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis code
- [ ] Specify glucose monitor model that requires platforms
- [ ] If assistive use: Document physical limitations
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order completed
- [ ] Confirm patient has covered glucose monitor
- [ ] Verify monitor model uses platform/chip technology
- [ ] If dexterity assistance: Document arthritis/impairment

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **VERIFY COVERAGE with Bureau of Medical Review (800) 342-3005 FIRST**
- [ ] Valid ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis on prescription
- [ ] Document monitor model requires platforms
- [ ] If assistive use: Document physical limitations requiring platform technology
- [ ] Obtain billing guidance if coverage confirmed

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Monitor doesn't use platforms"** - Patient's monitor uses standard test strips, not platforms. Fix: Verify monitor specifications - only certain models use platforms. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Code not covered"** (Medicaid) - A4255 not in fee schedule. Fix: Verify coverage with Bureau of Medical Review first. *(Under Review)*

3. **"Glucose monitor not covered"** - Patient doesn't have covered monitor. Fix: Ensure glucose monitor is covered. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No diabetes diagnosis"** - Missing or invalid ICD-10 code. Fix: Include valid diabetes diagnosis code. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Insufficient documentation"** - Missing SWO or monitor specifications. Fix: Complete all required documentation, specify monitor model. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Verify patient has covered glucose monitor *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Confirm monitor model specifically requires platform/chip technology *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Standard Written Order sufficient if monitor already covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If for dexterity assistance: Document specific physical limitations (arthritis, neuropathy, tremor) *(Under Review)*
- Quantity should align with patient's testing frequency *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **CRITICAL: Verify coverage with Bureau of Medical Review (800) 342-3005 before prescribing** *(Under Review)*
- Include valid ICD-10 diabetes code on prescription *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document monitor model that requires platforms *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If assistive device use: Document physical limitations making standard strips difficult *(Under Review)*
- If coverage confirmed: Follow specific billing guidance from NY Medicaid *(Under Review)*
