# A4253 - Blood Glucose Test Strips

## Clinical Overview

A4253 represents blood glucose test or reagent strips for home blood glucose monitoring, billed per 50 strips. These are essential consumable supplies for patients with diabetes who own a glucose monitor. The quantity covered depends on whether the patient is insulin-treated or non-insulin-treated, with insulin-treated patients typically authorized for higher quantities. The patient or caregiver must be trained in proper monitor use. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Update:** NY Medicaid changed quantity limits effective October 1, 2024. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Diabetes mellitus diagnosis
- Patient or caregiver trained to use prescribed monitor appropriately
- Treating practitioner determines training is sufficient
- Insulin vs. non-insulin treatment determines quantity limits

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim
- Prescription must include diabetes diagnosis code
- For usual utilization: No additional documentation needed
- For high utilization: In-person or telehealth visit within 6 months prior, plus follow-up visits every 6 months to document adherence

**Quantity Limits:**
- **Non-insulin treated:** Up to 100 strips per 3 months (usual utilization) - Use KS modifier
- **Insulin-treated:** Up to 300 strips per 3 months (usual utilization) - Use KX modifier
- **High utilization:** Quantities exceeding usual limits require face-to-face visits every 6 months

**Important Notes:**
- KX modifier certifies insulin-treated patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- KS modifier certifies non-insulin-treated patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- High utilization requires ongoing monitoring and documentation of medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Test strips must be compatible with patient's specific glucose monitor model *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Diabetes mellitus (Type 1, Type 2, or gestational) requiring home blood glucose monitoring
- Patient owns glucose monitor and is trained in proper use
- **Special note for E2100:** If patient uses voice synthesizer monitor, supporting documentation must indicate use with voice-capable monitor

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with diabetes diagnosis
- **Direct bill for standard quantities** - no prior authorization required
- **Excess quantities:** Prior approval required with documented medical necessity
- Valid diabetes diagnosis (ICD-10) required on prescription
- Proof of delivery required

**Quantity Limits (Effective October 1, 2024):**
- **Insulin users:** 300 strips per 3 months (direct bill)
- **Non-insulin users:** 100 strips per 3 months (direct bill)

- Standard quantities are direct bill - streamlined process *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must document insulin vs. non-insulin treatment status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Test strips must be compatible with patient's monitor model *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "A4253 - Blood glucose test strips, per 50 strips"
- [ ] ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis code
- [ ] Document insulin vs. non-insulin treatment status
- [ ] Specify glucose monitor model/brand for compatibility
- [ ] Quantity requested (within standard limits)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order completed
- [ ] Use KX modifier for insulin-treated patients
- [ ] Use KS modifier for non-insulin-treated patients
- [ ] If high utilization: Document face-to-face visits every 6 months
- [ ] Verify strips compatible with patient's monitor

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Valid ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis on prescription
- [ ] Clearly document insulin vs. non-insulin treatment
- [ ] Quantity within standard limits (300 for insulin, 100 for non-insulin per 3 months)
- [ ] If excess quantity: Include medical necessity justification for prior approval
- [ ] For E2100 monitor: Document voice synthesizer requirement

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Quantity exceeded"** - Requested quantity exceeds standard limits without justification. Fix: Stay within limits (300/3 months insulin, 100/3 months non-insulin) or document medical necessity for excess. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Incompatible strips"** - Strips don't match patient's monitor brand. Fix: Verify strip compatibility with specific monitor model. *(Under Review)*

3. **"No glucose monitor covered"** - Patient doesn't have covered monitor. Fix: Ensure glucose monitor is covered before ordering strips. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Missing modifier"** (Medicare) - KX or KS modifier not included. Fix: Use KX for insulin-treated, KS for non-insulin. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"High utilization not documented"** (Medicare) - Excess quantity without face-to-face visit documentation. Fix: Document required 6-month follow-up visits. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No diabetes diagnosis"** - Missing or invalid ICD-10 code. Fix: Include valid diabetes diagnosis code. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"Insulin status not documented"** (Medicaid) - Unclear whether patient uses insulin. Fix: Clearly document insulin vs. non-insulin treatment. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Always include appropriate modifier: KX for insulin-treated, KS for non-insulin *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Stay within usual utilization limits to avoid additional documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If high utilization needed: Schedule and document face-to-face visits every 6 months *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Verify strip brand matches patient's monitor model *(Under Review)*
- Standard Written Order sufficient for usual quantities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- Clearly document insulin vs. non-insulin treatment status on prescription *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Be aware of October 1, 2024 quantity limit changes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Standard quantities are direct bill - no authorization needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Only request excess quantities with strong medical necessity justification *(Under Review)*
- Verify strip compatibility with patient's specific monitor *(Under Review)*
- For voice synthesizer monitor (E2100): Document visual impairment and voice monitor requirement *(Under Review)*
