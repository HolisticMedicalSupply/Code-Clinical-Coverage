# A4256 - Glucose Monitor Calibrator Solution/Chips

## Clinical Overview

A4256 represents normal, low, and high calibrator solutions or chips used to calibrate and verify the accuracy of home blood glucose monitors. These quality control supplies ensure that the patient's glucose monitor is providing accurate readings per manufacturer specifications. Regular calibration is important for maintaining reliable glucose monitoring results. The patient must own a glucose monitor that requires calibration testing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Diabetes mellitus diagnosis
- Patient owns home blood glucose monitor
- Monitor requires calibration/quality control testing per manufacturer specifications
- Used to ensure monitor accuracy

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim
- Covered when glucose monitor covered
- Beneficiary must own glucose monitor requiring calibration
- Document monitor ownership (E0607, E2100, E2101, E2102, E2103, E2104)

**Important Notes:**
- Used for quality control testing to ensure monitor accuracy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Includes normal, low, and high level calibrators for comprehensive testing *(Under Review)*
- Frequency based on manufacturer recommendations and medical necessity *(Under Review)*
- No separate documentation needed if glucose monitor already covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Diabetes mellitus requiring glucose monitor calibration to ensure accuracy of blood glucose testing
- Patient owns glucose monitor requiring quality control testing
- Valid diabetes diagnosis required

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with diabetes diagnosis
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED** before delivery (# code designation)
- Frequency: F10 (once per 10 periods, interpreted as 2 per year)
- Must document need for quality control testing
- Proof of delivery required

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required BEFORE delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency F10 = 2 per year maximum *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Used to verify monitor is providing accurate glucose readings *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quality control testing important for patient safety and treatment decisions *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, DVS authorization, and frequency limits are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "A4256 - Normal, low and high calibrator solution/chips"
- [ ] ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis code
- [ ] Document patient owns glucose monitor requiring calibration
- [ ] Specify monitor model if known
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order completed
- [ ] Confirm patient has covered glucose monitor
- [ ] Verify monitor requires calibration testing
- [ ] Quantity based on manufacturer recommendations

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Valid ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis on prescription
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained by supplier before delivery
- [ ] Frequency limit: 2 per year (F10)
- [ ] Document medical necessity for quality control testing
- [ ] Monitor model specified

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Glucose monitor not covered"** - Patient doesn't have covered monitor. Fix: Ensure glucose monitor is covered before ordering calibration supplies. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before authorization. Fix: Supplier must obtain authorization first. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - More than 2 per year ordered. Fix: Limit to maximum 2 per year (F10 frequency). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No diabetes diagnosis"** - Missing or invalid ICD-10 code. Fix: Include valid diabetes diagnosis code. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Monitor doesn't require calibration"** - Some monitors self-calibrate. Fix: Verify monitor specifications require external calibration testing. *(Under Review)*

6. **"Insufficient documentation"** - Missing SWO or monitor ownership documentation. Fix: Complete all required documentation. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Verify patient has covered glucose monitor before ordering calibrators *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Confirm monitor specifications require calibration testing (not all monitors do) *(Under Review)*
- Standard Written Order sufficient if monitor already covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quantity should align with manufacturer calibration recommendations *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Include valid ICD-10 diabetes code on prescription *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Supplier must obtain DVS authorization before delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Maximum 2 per year (F10 frequency) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document medical necessity for quality control testing *(Under Review)*
- Verify monitor model requires external calibration *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0607** - Home blood glucose monitor (standard) - The primary device that calibrators are used with. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **E2100-E2104** - Specialized glucose monitors - May also require calibration depending on model specifications. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **A4253** - Blood glucose test strips - Used for actual patient testing; calibrators verify strip/monitor accuracy. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **A4255** - Platforms for blood glucose monitor - Different accessory for certain monitor types. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
