# E0620 - Laser Skin Piercing Device

## Clinical Overview

**DM06 - MAIL ORDER CATEGORY:** This code is part of the MAIL ORDER blood glucose monitoring supplies category. Clinical coverage criteria are identical to DM05 (non-mail order), but supplies are delivered via mail order pharmacy or DME mail order provider. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

E0620 represents a laser skin piercing device used for collection of capillary blood during glucose testing. Laser devices use focused laser energy to create a small puncture in the skin for blood sample collection, as an alternative to conventional spring-powered lancet devices. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE INFORMATION:**
- **Medicare: NOT COVERED** - Medical necessity not established *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **NY Medicaid: NOT COVERED** - Conventional devices are standard of care *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
