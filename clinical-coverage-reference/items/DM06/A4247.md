# A4247 - Betadine/Iodine Antiseptic Swabs

## Clinical Overview

**DM06 - MAIL ORDER CATEGORY:** This code is part of the MAIL ORDER blood glucose monitoring supplies category. Clinical coverage criteria are identical to DM05 (non-mail order), but supplies are delivered via mail order pharmacy or DME mail order provider. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

A4247 represents Betadine or iodine antiseptic swabs/wipes (per box) used by patients with diabetes for skin preparation before fingerstick blood glucose testing. These single-use, pre-moistened antiseptic wipes provide convenient infection prevention at the puncture site. They offer a portable, pre-packaged alternative to antiseptic solution (A4246). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL NOTE FOR NY MEDICAID:** This code is **NOT FOUND** in NY Medicaid DME/Medical Supply manuals effective 10/1/2025. Verify coverage with NYRx before prescribing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No diabetes diagnosis"** - Missing or invalid ICD-10 code. Fix: Include valid diabetes diagnosis code. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Excessive quantity"** - Quantity not reasonable for medical necessity. Fix: Document quantity justification based on testing frequency. *(Under Review)*

5. **"Insufficient documentation"** (Medicare) - Missing SWO. Fix: Complete Standard Written Order. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Verify patient has covered glucose monitor *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Standard Written Order sufficient if monitor already covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Quantity should align with patient's testing frequency (typically 1 swab per test) *(Under Review)*

- Code NOT FOUND in current NY Medicaid manuals *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
