# E2103 - Non-Adjunctive (Therapeutic) CGM Receiver

## Clinical Overview

**DM06 - MAIL ORDER CATEGORY:** This code is part of the MAIL ORDER blood glucose monitoring supplies category. Clinical coverage criteria are identical to DM05 (non-mail order), but supplies are delivered via mail order pharmacy or DME mail order provider. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

E2103 is a non-adjunctive (therapeutic) continuous glucose monitor (CGM) receiver that **replaces standard blood glucose monitoring** for treatment decisions. This device continuously measures interstitial glucose levels and is used as the primary glucose monitoring method rather than supplementing fingerstick testing. It is appropriate for patients with diabetes who are insulin-treated OR have a history of problematic hypoglycemia. The device is prescribed per FDA indications for improving glycemic control. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Code Update:** E2103 **replaced K0554 effective January 1, 2023**. Claims for K0554 submitted after 1/1/2023 are denied; suppliers must use E2103. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important NY Medicaid Update:** Dexcom and Freestyle CGMs available **ONLY through pharmacy providers (not DME)** effective June 3, 2024. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Code not recognized"** (Medicare, if K0554 used after 1/1/2023) - Old code used. Fix: Use E2103 instead of K0554 for all claims after 1/1/2023. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Billed to DME provider"** (Medicaid, after 6/3/24) - PDSP product billed to DME. Fix: Route Dexcom/Freestyle CGMs to pharmacy providers only after 6/3/24. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Missing CG modifier"** (Medicare) - CG modifier not included. Fix: Always include CG modifier when billing CGM equipment/supplies. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"6-month visit not documented"** (Medicare) - Missing required face-to-face visit. Fix: Document initial visit within 6 months prior and schedule ongoing 6-month visits. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Criteria not met"** - Patient not insulin-treated AND no problematic hypoglycemia history. Fix: Document either insulin treatment OR hypoglycemia history (recurrent <54mg/dL or level 3). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"WOPD not obtained"** (Medicare) - Device delivered before order received. Fix: Obtain complete order BEFORE delivery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"Not on PDAC list"** (Medicare) - Device not on Product Classification List. Fix: Verify device is PDAC-listed before ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Standard BGM supplies billed"** - E0607, A4253, or A4259 billed with E2103. Fix: Cannot bill standard BGM supplies with therapeutic CGM - CGM replaces fingerstick testing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
