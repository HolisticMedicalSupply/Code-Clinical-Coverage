# E0607 - Standard Blood Glucose Monitor

## Clinical Overview

**DM06 - MAIL ORDER CATEGORY:** This code is part of the MAIL ORDER blood glucose monitoring supplies category. Clinical coverage criteria are identical to DM05 (non-mail order), but supplies are delivered via mail order pharmacy or DME mail order provider. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

E0607 is a standard home blood glucose monitor used by patients with diabetes to perform fingerstick blood glucose testing. This is the most common glucose monitoring device and includes standard features such as blood sample application, glucose reading display, and memory for storing results. The device requires test strips (A4253), lancets (A4259), and a lancing device (A4258) for operation. The treating practitioner must determine that the patient or caregiver has sufficient training to use the device appropriately. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

- Monitor is the base equipment - supplies (strips, lancets) billed separately *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency limit ensures reasonable useful lifetime before replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Diabetes mellitus (Type 1, Type 2, or gestational) requiring home blood glucose monitoring for diabetes management
- Patient/caregiver trained in proper monitor use and testing technique
- Standard glucose monitor (not specialized features)

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Monitor is base equipment - test strips, lancets, batteries, etc. are separate supply items *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, frequency limits, and direct bill status are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0607 - Home blood glucose monitor"
- [ ] ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis code
- [ ] Document patient/caregiver training and competency
- [ ] Document insulin vs. non-insulin treatment status
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order with WOPD completed **before delivery**
- [ ] Use KX modifier for insulin-treated patients
- [ ] Use KS modifier for non-insulin-treated patients
- [ ] Verify frequency limit (3-5 years) not exceeded
- [ ] Document training competency
- [ ] If early replacement: Document monitor lost, stolen, or irreparably damaged

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Valid ICD-10 diabetes diagnosis on prescription
- [ ] Verify frequency limit (3 years) not exceeded
- [ ] Direct bill - no authorization needed
- [ ] Standard monitor only (not specialized features)
- [ ] If early replacement: Document reason

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Frequency exceeded"** - Monitor ordered too soon after previous monitor. Fix: Medicare allows 1 per 3-5 years, Medicaid allows 1 per 3 years. Verify timing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"WOPD not obtained"** (Medicare) - Device delivered before Written Order Prior to Delivery received. Fix: Obtain complete order BEFORE delivery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Missing modifier"** (Medicare) - KX or KS modifier not included. Fix: Use KX for insulin-treated, KS for non-insulin. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No diabetes diagnosis"** - Missing or invalid ICD-10 code. Fix: Include valid diabetes diagnosis code. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Billed with E2103"** (Medicare) - Standard monitor billed with non-adjunctive CGM. Fix: Patient uses either standard monitor OR therapeutic CGM, not both. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Training not documented"** - Insufficient documentation of patient/caregiver competency. Fix: Document training and demonstrated competency. *(Under Review)*

7. **"Premature replacement"** - New monitor requested before frequency limit. Fix: Document monitor lost, stolen, or irreparably damaged if early replacement needed. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Obtain WOPD BEFORE delivering device - this is critical *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include appropriate modifier: KX for insulin-treated, KS for non-insulin *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Respect 3-5 year frequency limit - verify last monitor date *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document patient/caregiver training and demonstrated competency *(Under Review)*
- If early replacement needed: Document monitor is lost, stolen, or irreparably damaged *(Under Review)*
- Do not bill E0607 if patient has therapeutic CGM (E2103) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- Include valid ICD-10 diabetes code on prescription *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Respect 3-year frequency limit - verify last monitor date *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Direct bill item - no authorization needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Standard monitor only - specialized monitors use different codes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document training and competency *(Under Review)*
- If early replacement needed: Document reason (lost, stolen, broken) *(Under Review)*
