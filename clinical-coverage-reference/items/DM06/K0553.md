# K0553 - DISCONTINUED: Therapeutic CGM Supplies

## CRITICAL NOTICE: CODE DISCONTINUED

**K0553 was DISCONTINUED effective January 1, 2023.**

**✅ CURRENT CODE TO USE: A4239**

All claims for K0553 submitted after January 1, 2023 will be **DENIED**.

Medicare crosswalked K0553 to **A4239** (Supply allowance for non-adjunctive, non-implanted continuous glucose monitor).

**Suppliers must use A4239 for all therapeutic CGM supply claims.**

## Code Transition Information

**Discontinuation Date:** January 1, 2023 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Replacement Code:** A4239 - Supply allowance for non-adjunctive (therapeutic) CGM, 1 month supply *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Why the Change:** Medicare standardized CGM coding by transitioning K-codes to A-codes and E-codes for improved claims processing and coverage consistency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Historical Coverage (For Reference Only)

### Medicare (Historical - No Longer Applicable)

K0553 was previously used for therapeutic CGM supplies (1 month supply = 1 unit). The code covered sensors, transmitters, and all accessories for non-adjunctive CGM systems.

**Current code:** Use **A4239** instead.

### NY Medicaid (Historical - No Longer Applicable)

K0553 was previously used for Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes patients using therapeutic CGM that replaces standard blood glucose monitoring. It included CGM sensor, transmitter, home BGM, test strips, lancets, and calibration solutions. Billed with K0554 receiver; one unit per month maximum.

**Current code:** Use **A4239** for supplies (and E2103 for receiver instead of K0554).

## Action Items for Healthcare Providers

**If you are trying to order therapeutic CGM supplies:**

1. **Use code A4239** - Do NOT use K0553
2. Verify patient has therapeutic CGM receiver (E2103, not K0554)
3. Follow current coverage criteria for therapeutic CGM (See A4239 documentation)
4. Ensure all documentation references current codes, not discontinued K-codes

**For Medicare Claims:**
- K0553 claims after 1/1/2023: **DENIED**
- Use A4239 for all new claims
- Include CG modifier
- Follow current therapeutic CGM LCD requirements

**For Medicaid Claims:**
- Transition to A4239 for supply allowance
- Follow current DVS authorization requirements
- One unit per month (F9 frequency)
