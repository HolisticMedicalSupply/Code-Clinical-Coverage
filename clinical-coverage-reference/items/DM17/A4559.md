# A4559 - Coupling Gel for Ultrasound Bone Growth Stimulator

## Clinical Overview

A4559 represents ultrasonic coupling gel used exclusively with the E0760 low intensity ultrasound osteogenesis stimulator. This coupling gel is required for proper transmission of ultrasound waves through the skin to the bone fracture site. The gel reduces air gaps between the ultrasound transducer and skin, ensuring effective ultrasound energy delivery to promote bone healing in nonunion fractures. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** A4559 is NOT separately billable - it is bundled with E0760 authorization. Coverage is tied directly to E0760 device coverage. Cannot be billed for other ultrasound applications (diagnostic ultrasound, therapeutic ultrasound for soft tissue, etc.). Only covered when E0760 is medically necessary and approved for nonunion fracture treatment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
