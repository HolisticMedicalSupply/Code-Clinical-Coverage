# E0748 - Electrical Bone Growth Stimulator (Spinal)

## Clinical Overview

E0748 represents an electrical osteogenesis stimulator specifically for spinal applications. The device promotes bone healing in failed spinal fusions, multilevel spinal fusions, or high-risk fusion cases. Unlike non-spinal devices (E0747), E0748 is designed for the unique biomechanical environment of the spine and is indicated when surgical fusion has not achieved solid bony union. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL UPDATE (8/28/2024):** Medicare has SUSPENDED prior authorization requirements for E0748. Claims are now processed without advance PA. However, NY Medicaid has NOT suspended PA - prior approval still required for Medicaid patients. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Indications (one of the following):**

1. **Failed spinal fusion** - â‰¥9 months post-surgery at same surgical site without radiographic evidence of healing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Multilevel spinal fusion** - Following fusion of â‰¥3 vertebrae (e.g., L3-L4-L5 fusion) to promote solid fusion *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **High risk of pseudarthrosis** - Previous failed fusion at same spinal site requiring revision surgery with high risk of non-union *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Face-to-face encounter within 6 months** before prescription *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Medical records documenting indication:**
  - **For failed fusion:** Radiographic evidence â‰¥9 months post-op showing no solid fusion
  - **For multilevel fusion:** Operative report showing â‰¥3 vertebrae fused
  - **For high-risk revision:** Documentation of previous failed fusion at same site
- **KF modifier required** when billing (Class III FDA device) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Spinal level(s) affected
- Treatment plan

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:**

- **NO prior authorization required** as of 8/28/2024 - CMS suspended PA *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Claims processed without advance approval
- Still must meet clinical criteria

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - failed fusion, multilevel fusion, or high-risk pseudarthrosis *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Prior approval REQUIRED** - NY Medicaid has NOT suspended PA *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face encounter within 6 months documented
- **Operative reports** showing:
  - Original fusion surgery details (date, levels fused)
  - If multilevel: Documentation of â‰¥3 vertebrae fused
  - If revision: Previous failed fusion documentation
- **Radiographic evidence** (if failed fusion): X-rays/CT showing lack of solid fusion â‰¥9 months post-op
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review for approval

**Important Notes:**

- High-cost specialized device
- Spine surgeon evaluation typically required
- Unlike Medicare, advance prior approval mandatory

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Same requirements as Nassau County.** Prior approval required, operative reports, radiographic evidence if applicable.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0748 - Osteogenesis stimulator, electrical, spinal"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (M96.0, M43.xx, M48.8x)
- [ ] **Indication (specify one):**
  - [ ] Failed spinal fusion (â‰¥9 months post-op without healing)
    - Original fusion date: _______
    - Spinal levels: _______
    - Radiographic evidence of non-union
  - [ ] Multilevel spinal fusion (â‰¥3 vertebrae)
    - Fusion date: _______
    - Levels fused (must be â‰¥3): _______
    - Operative report attached
  - [ ] High-risk pseudarthrosis (previous failed fusion, revision surgery)
    - Previous fusion date and failure: _______
    - Revision surgery date: _______
    - Same spinal levels as previous failed fusion
- [ ] **Face-to-face encounter within 6 months** - date documented
- [ ] Expected treatment duration
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] WOPD completed
- [ ] KF modifier will be applied when billing
- [ ] Face-to-face documented
- [ ] **NO prior authorization needed** (suspended 8/28/2024)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Prior approval obtained BEFORE ordering**
- [ ] Submit operative reports with prior approval request
- [ ] Submit radiographic evidence if failed fusion
- [ ] Face-to-face encounter documented
- [ ] Fiscal order comprehensive

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Insufficient time post-fusion"** - <9 months for failed fusion indication. Fix: For failed fusion indication, must be â‰¥9 months post-surgery. Earlier use not covered. Wait until 9-month mark. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"<3 vertebrae fused"** - Multilevel fusion claim with only 2 levels. Fix: Multilevel fusion indication requires â‰¥3 vertebrae. If only 2 levels fused, must qualify under failed fusion (â‰¥9 months) or high-risk revision. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No operative report"** - Missing surgical documentation. Fix: Must provide operative report documenting fusion surgery details (date, levels, approach). Required for all indications. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No radiographic evidence of failed fusion"** - Failed fusion claimed without imaging. Fix: If claiming failed fusion, must provide X-rays or CT showing lack of solid bony union â‰¥9 months post-op. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No face-to-face documentation"** - F2F not within 6 months. Fix: Face-to-face encounter must be within 6 months before device prescription. Document encounter date. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"KF modifier missing"** (Medicare) - Billing error. Fix: E0748 requires KF modifier (Class III FDA device). Add modifier to claim. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Device ordered without PA. Fix: NY Medicaid still requires prior approval. Obtain PA before ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Non-spinal application"** - Used for non-spinal bone. Fix: E0748 is for SPINAL applications only. For non-spinal bones, use E0747. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **PA no longer required** as of 8/28/2024 - major simplification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Still must meet clinical criteria
- Face-to-face within 6 months mandatory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete WOPD before device delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Use KF modifier when billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **For failed fusion:** Document â‰¥9 months post-op + radiographic non-union
- **For multilevel fusion:** Operative report showing â‰¥3 vertebrae clearly stated
- **For high-risk revision:** Document previous failed fusion at same site

**Medicaid:**
- Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering - still required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit comprehensive documentation package:
  - Operative report(s)
  - Radiographic evidence if failed fusion
  - Face-to-face encounter note
  - Fiscal order with clear indication justification
- Spine surgeon evaluation strengthens approval
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review early
