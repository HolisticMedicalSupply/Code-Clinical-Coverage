# E0760 - Low Intensity Ultrasound Bone Growth Stimulator

## Clinical Overview

E0760 represents a low intensity ultrasound osteogenesis stimulator used to promote bone healing in nonunion fractures. Unlike electrical stimulators (E0747, E0748), this device uses low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) to stimulate bone formation. The device is indicated for fractures that have ceased healing for â‰¥90 days with radiographic confirmation of nonunion. E0760 may be used as a non-surgical intervention before considering revision surgery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL UPDATE (8/28/2024):** Medicare has SUSPENDED prior authorization requirements for E0760. Claims are now processed without advance PA. However, NY Medicaid has NOT suspended PA - prior approval still required for Medicaid patients. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS:** E0760 is NOT covered for: (1) skull fractures, (2) vertebral/spinal fractures (use E0748 for spinal applications), (3) tumor-related fractures, (4) fresh fractures, or (5) delayed unions (must be true nonunion). Cannot be used concurrently with E0747 or E0748. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

1. **Nonunion fracture** - Documented fracture with cessation of healing for â‰¥90 days *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Radiographic confirmation** - Two sets of radiographs taken â‰¥90 days apart showing:
   - No evidence of healing progression
   - Persistent fracture line
   - Lack of callus formation or bridging bone *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **NOT one of the excluded fracture types:**
   - NOT skull fracture
   - NOT vertebral/spinal fracture (use E0748 instead)
   - NOT tumor-related fracture (pathologic fracture from metastasis or primary bone tumor) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **Single device limitation** - Cannot be used concurrently with E0747 or E0748 at same or different fracture site *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0760 - Osteogenesis stimulator, low intensity ultrasound"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code with 7th character K for nonunion (S42.xxxK, S52.xxxK, S72.xxxK, etc.) or M84.4xx
- [ ] **Fracture location and type:**
  - [ ] Specific anatomical site (e.g., "distal radius," "tibial shaft," "femoral neck")
  - [ ] Confirm fracture is NOT skull, spine, or tumor-related
  - [ ] Initial fracture date: _______
- [ ] **Radiographic documentation:**
  - [ ] First X-ray date and findings: _______
  - [ ] Second X-ray date (â‰¥90 days after first): _______
  - [ ] Physician interpretation both sets: "Nonunion - no healing progression between [date 1] and [date 2]"
  - [ ] Persistent fracture line without bridging callus
- [ ] **Device exclusivity:**
  - [ ] Confirm NOT using E0747 or E0748 concurrently
  - [ ] Only one osteogenic device per patient

- [ ] **NO prior authorization needed** (suspended 8/28/2024)
- [ ] A4559 coupling gel included (not separately billable)

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Submit both radiograph sets with prior approval request
- [ ] Submit physician interpretations documenting nonunion
- [ ] Face-to-face encounter documented
- [ ] Fiscal order comprehensive

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"<90 days since fracture"** - Insufficient time for nonunion determination. Fix: Must be â‰¥90 days since initial fracture. Fresh fractures and delayed unions not covered - must be true nonunion. Wait until 90-day mark and obtain second X-ray showing no healing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Only one radiograph"** - Missing second X-ray. Fix: Must provide TWO radiograph sets taken â‰¥90 days apart. First X-ray documents initial fracture, second X-ray (â‰¥90 days later) confirms nonunion without healing progression. Both need physician interpretation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Skull/spine fracture"** - Excluded fracture location. Fix: E0760 NOT covered for skull or spinal fractures. For spinal nonunion, use E0748. For skull fractures, device not indicated. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Tumor-related fracture"** - Pathologic fracture from cancer. Fix: E0760 not covered for fractures through tumor sites (metastatic or primary bone tumor). Pathologic fractures from osteoporosis may be covered if meet other criteria. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Concurrent E0747/E0748"** - Using multiple osteogenic devices. Fix: Cannot use E0760 concurrently with E0747 or E0748. Choose one device based on fracture location and type. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No face-to-face documentation"** - F2F not within 6 months. Fix: Face-to-face encounter must be within 6 months before device prescription. Document encounter date. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No physician interpretation of X-rays"** - Radiographs without interpretation. Fix: Both radiograph sets must have physician interpretation explicitly stating "nonunion" and "no healing progression between [date 1] and [date 2]." Radiologist or treating physician interpretation acceptable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"KF modifier missing"** (Medicare) - Billing error. Fix: E0760 requires KF modifier (Class III FDA device). Add modifier to claim. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

9. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Device ordered without PA. Fix: NY Medicaid still requires prior approval. Obtain PA before ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

10. **"Separate billing for A4559"** - Billing error. Fix: A4559 coupling gel is bundled with E0760. Do not bill separately. Included in device authorization. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **PA no longer required** as of 8/28/2024 - major simplification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Still must meet clinical criteria
- Face-to-face within 6 months mandatory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete WOPD before device delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Use KF modifier when billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Two X-rays â‰¥90 days apart are THE critical documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - First X-ray: Initial fracture (establish baseline)
  - Second X-ray: â‰¥90 days later showing NO healing progression
  - Both X-rays need physician interpretation clearly stating "nonunion"
- Document fracture location is NOT skull, spine, or tumor-related *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Confirm no concurrent E0747/E0748 use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Orthopedic surgeon prescription strengthens case *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering - still required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit comprehensive documentation package:
  - Both radiograph sets (â‰¥90 days apart)
  - Physician interpretations for both sets
  - Face-to-face encounter note
  - Exclusion documentation (NOT skull/spine/tumor)
  - Confirmation no concurrent E0747/E0748
  - Fiscal order with clear clinical justification
- Orthopedic surgeon evaluation strengthens approval *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review early *(Under Review)*
- Explain why ultrasound vs. electrical stimulation chosen (patient preference, prior electrical stimulation failure, etc.) *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0748** - Osteogenesis stimulator, electrical, spinal - For SPINAL applications only (failed fusion, multilevel fusion). Use this instead of E0760 for vertebral fractures. Cannot be used concurrently with E0760. See DM17 category. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **A4559** - Coupling gel/paste for ultrasound - BUNDLED with E0760, not separately billable. Included in device authorization. See DM17 category. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
