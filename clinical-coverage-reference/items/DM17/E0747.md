# E0747 - Electrical Bone Growth Stimulator (Non-Spinal)

## Clinical Overview

E0747 represents an electrical osteogenesis stimulator used for non-spinal applications to promote bone healing. The device delivers low-level electrical current to stimulate bone growth in fracture nonunions, failed joint fusions, and congenital pseudarthrosis. Unlike surgical implants, this is a non-invasive external device worn by the patient to electrically stimulate bone formation when natural healing has failed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL UPDATE (8/28/2024):** Medicare has SUSPENDED prior authorization requirements for E0747. Claims are now processed without advance PA. However, NY Medicaid has NOT suspended PA - prior approval still required for Medicaid patients. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Indications (one of the following):**

1. **Long bone fracture nonunion** - Radiographic evidence showing healing has ceased for â‰¥3 months in:
   - Clavicle, humerus, radius, ulna (upper extremity)
   - Femur, tibia, fibula (lower extremity)
   - Metacarpal, metatarsal (hands/feet) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Failed joint fusion (non-spine)** - â‰¥9 months post-surgery without radiographic evidence of healing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **Congenital pseudarthrosis** - Congenital bone defect requiring stimulation *(Under Review)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Face-to-face encounter within 6 months** before prescription *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Two radiograph sets â‰¥90 days apart** with physician interpretation confirming nonunion *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **KF modifier required** when billing (Class III FDA device) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Diagnosis with ICD-10 code for nonunion or pseudarthrosis
- Treatment plan and expected duration

**IMPORTANT UPDATE:**

- **NO prior authorization required** as of 8/28/2024 - CMS suspended PA *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Claims processed without advance approval
- Still must meet clinical criteria and provide documentation

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - long bone nonunion, failed joint fusion non-spine, or congenital pseudarthrosis *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Prior approval REQUIRED** - NY Medicaid has NOT suspended PA *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face encounter within 6 months documented
- **Two radiograph sets â‰¥90 days apart** showing nonunion
- Physician interpretation confirming nonunion/failed fusion
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review for approval process

**Important Notes:**

- Unlike Medicare, Medicaid still requires advance prior approval
- Same clinical criteria as Medicare
- High-cost device requiring comprehensive documentation

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Same requirements as Nassau County.** Prior approval required, face-to-face within 6 months, two X-rays 90+ days apart.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0747 - Osteogenesis stimulator, electrical, non-spinal"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code for nonunion or pseudarthrosis (M84.1xx, M96.0, Q68.8)
- [ ] **Indication (specify one):**
  - [ ] Long bone fracture nonunion (specify bone: femur, tibia, humerus, etc.)
  - [ ] Failed joint fusion non-spine (specify joint, date of surgery)
  - [ ] Congenital pseudarthrosis
- [ ] **Face-to-face encounter within 6 months** - date documented
- [ ] **Two radiograph sets â‰¥90 days apart:**
  - [ ] First X-ray date and findings
  - [ ] Second X-ray date (â‰¥90 days later) and findings
  - [ ] Physician interpretation confirming nonunion/lack of healing progression
- [ ] Bone(s) affected (specific anatomical location)
- [ ] Expected treatment duration
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] WOPD completed
- [ ] KF modifier will be applied when billing
- [ ] Face-to-face and two X-rays documented
- [ ] **NO prior authorization needed** (suspended 8/28/2024)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Prior approval obtained BEFORE ordering**
- [ ] Submit two X-ray reports with prior approval request
- [ ] Face-to-face encounter documented
- [ ] Fiscal order comprehensive

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"<2 radiograph sets"** - Only one X-ray submitted. Fix: MUST have two radiograph sets â‰¥90 days apart showing nonunion. Single X-ray insufficient. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"X-rays <90 days apart"** - Radiographs too close together. Fix: Second X-ray must be â‰¥90 days after first X-ray to demonstrate persistent nonunion over time. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No physician interpretation"** - X-rays without interpretation. Fix: Physician must interpret radiographs and document nonunion/lack of healing. Radiology report alone may not suffice - ordering physician interpretation required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No face-to-face documentation"** - F2F not within 6 months. Fix: Face-to-face encounter must be within 6 months before device prescription. Document encounter date and clinical findings. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"KF modifier missing"** (Medicare) - Billing error. Fix: E0747 requires KF modifier (Class III FDA device). Add modifier to claim. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - Device ordered without PA. Fix: NY Medicaid still requires prior approval despite Medicare PA suspension. Obtain PA before ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"Spinal application"** - Used for spine. Fix: E0747 is for NON-SPINAL applications only. For spinal fusion, use E0748. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **PA no longer required** as of 8/28/2024 - major simplification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Still must meet clinical criteria and provide documentation
- Face-to-face within 6 months mandatory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Two X-rays â‰¥90 days apart showing nonunion required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete WOPD before device delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Use KF modifier when billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Physician interpretation of both X-rays confirming nonunion

**Medicaid:**
- Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering - still required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Submit comprehensive documentation package with PA request:
  - Two X-ray reports (â‰¥90 days apart)
  - Physician interpretation confirming nonunion
  - Face-to-face encounter note
  - Fiscal order with clinical justification
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review early in process
- Same clinical criteria as Medicare

## Related Codes

- **E0748** - Osteogenesis stimulator, electrical, spinal - For SPINAL applications (failed spinal fusion, multilevel fusion). See DM17 category. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **E0760** - Osteogenesis stimulator, low intensity ultrasound - Alternative bone stimulation method using ultrasound instead of electricity. Cannot be used concurrently with E0747. See DM17 category. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

- **A4559** - Coupling gel for ultrasound device - Used with E0760, not E0747. See DM17 category. *(Under Review)*
