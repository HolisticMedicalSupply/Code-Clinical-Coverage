## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No E0221 system ownership"** - Patient doesn't own infrared heating pad system. Fix: Verify E0221 ownership before ordering A4639. If no system, order E0221 first. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Medical necessity not documented"** - No documentation of continued need. Fix: Document original condition still present and infrared therapy still medically necessary. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Frequency exceeded"** - Replacement pads ordered too frequently. Fix: Verify frequency limits; document unusual wear pattern if early replacement needed. *(Under Review)*

4. **"No diagnosis"** - Missing or invalid ICD-10 code. Fix: Include diagnosis matching original E0221 indication. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Insufficient documentation"** - Missing written order or system ownership documentation. Fix: Complete all required documentation; verify E0221 in patient's equipment records. *(Under Review)*

6. **"Excessive quantity"** - Quantity exceeds reasonable replacement needs. Fix: Order reasonable quantity based on pad lifespan and usage patterns. *(Under Review)*
