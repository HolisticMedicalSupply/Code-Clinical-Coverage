# E1239 - Pediatric Power Wheelchair, Not Otherwise Specified

## Clinical Overview

E1239 is for pediatric power wheelchairs when other pediatric PWC codes don't apply. Designed for children with congenital or developmental conditions requiring power mobility with pediatric-specific sizing. Addresses unique pediatric needs including growth potential, developmental considerations, and child-appropriate sizing. PT/OT evaluation with pediatric expertise strongly recommended.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All standard PWC clinical criteria (MRADL impairment, UE limitations)
- **Pediatric-specific requirements**:
  - Child's size requires pediatric frame (standard adult sizes inappropriate)
  - Growth potential and trajectory documented
  - Developmental assessment showing need for independent power mobility
  - Cognitive/physical ability to safely operate OR caregiver supervision
- Congenital or developmental condition typically present

**Documentation Requirements:**
- F2F within 45 days with pediatric considerations
- **Developmental assessment**: Current developmental level, mobility needs for age-appropriate activities
- **Growth documentation**: Current measurements, expected growth trajectory
- **Pediatric sizing justification**: Why adult sizes inappropriate
- **PT/OT evaluation strongly recommended**: Especially with pediatric expertise
- 7-Element WOPD
- DPD signed before delivery
- Home assessment (including school/daycare environment if applicable) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **Not on CMS required PA list** but may be subject to review
- **Modifier KE required** if in competitive bidding area
- Capped rental applies (13 months) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Replacement for growth may be considered** earlier than standard 5-year cycle
- **Pediatric chairs may qualify as Group 5** if growth capability documented
- One device at a time

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All standard PWC criteria
- Pediatric evaluation required
- Growth assessment and projections
- Developmental considerations

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Fiscal order
- Pediatric-specific evaluation
- Growth projections with measurements
- PT/OT with pediatric expertise recommended
- School/daycare mobility needs documented if applicable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No financial relationship with supplier

**Important Notes:**
- May have different frequency allowances for growth-related replacements
- Earlier replacement may be considered when child outgrows chair
- Developmental needs may justify features not typically covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All standard PWC requirements
- [ ] **Pediatric diagnosis** (congenital/developmental condition)
- [ ] **Developmental assessment**: Current level, age-appropriate mobility needs
- [ ] **Growth documentation**: Current measurements (height, weight, sitting dimensions)
- [ ] **Expected growth trajectory**: Anticipated growth over next 2-5 years
- [ ] **Pediatric sizing justification**: Why adult sizes inappropriate
- [ ] Safe operation capability for child's developmental level
- [ ] ICD-10 codes appropriate for pediatric condition
- [ ] Signature, date, NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] F2F within 45 days including developmental assessment
- [ ] 7-element WOPD
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation (strongly recommended)
- [ ] Modifier KE if in competitive bidding area

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Prior approval obtained
- [ ] Fiscal order
- [ ] Pediatric PT/OT evaluation
- [ ] School/daycare mobility needs addressed (if applicable)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Adult-sized chair more appropriate"** - Insufficient justification for pediatric sizing. Fix: Include specific measurements showing child's body dimensions require pediatric frame: "Child height 42 inches, weight 50 lbs; standard adult chair seat depth 18-20" excessive for child's 12" thigh length; pediatric sizing required." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Developmental assessment insufficient"** - Lack of developmental considerations. Fix: Include developmental milestone assessment, cognitive level, and how power mobility supports age-appropriate development and learning. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Growth accommodation not addressed"** - No documentation of growth considerations. Fix: Include growth chart projections, anticipated growth rate, and how chair accommodates growth (adjustable features). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Safe operation not documented"** - Concerns about child's ability to safely operate. Fix: Document cognitive level, safe operation demonstration, supervision plan, and developmental appropriateness.

5. **"Standard PWC requirements not met"** - Basic PWC criteria insufficient. Fix: Ensure all standard MRADL impairment and UE limitation documentation included.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Include comprehensive developmental assessment** by pediatric specialist
- Document specific measurements showing need for pediatric sizing
- Address growth: "Current measurements X; projected growth to Y over 3-year period; chair features Z adjustability to accommodate growth"
- Include PT/OT evaluation by therapist with pediatric experience
- Document age-appropriate MRADL needs: "Independent mobility essential for school participation, social interaction with peers, age-appropriate exploration" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Address safety with supervision plan if needed
- Remember modifier KE if in competitive bidding area

**Medicaid:**
- Emphasize developmental needs and age-appropriate mobility
- Include school/daycare environment assessment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document how mobility affects learning and development
- Request PT/OT with pediatric expertise
- Address growth projections with specific measurements
- May request earlier replacement consideration - document outgrowing of chair
