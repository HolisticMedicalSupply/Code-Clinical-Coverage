# K0814 - Group 1 Standard Power Wheelchair (Portable, Captain's Chair)

## Clinical Overview

K0814 is a Group 1 standard power wheelchair with portable design, featuring a captain's chair seat. The captain's chair is an automotive-style cushioned seat built into the wheelchair, appropriate for beneficiaries without special positioning or skin protection needs. This code is used when a general-use cushion is not separately needed, making the captain's chair the least costly alternative. The portable design means the largest component weighs 55 pounds or less.

## Coverage Details

- Cognitive and physical ability to safely operate power wheelchair OR caregiver available, willing, and able to assist
- Patient weight up to and including 300 pounds
- No need for Group 2+ enhanced performance features
- **No special positioning or skin protection cushion needed** (if separate cushion required, K0813 with separate cushion code is more appropriate)

**Technical Specifications:**
- Length ≤40 inches

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting mobility limitation
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Documentation of insufficient UE function for manual wheelchair self-propulsion
- [ ] Statement that cane/walker insufficient
- [ ] Patient weight (must be ≤300 lbs)
- [ ] Safe operation capability OR caregiver availability
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number
- [ ] Length of need

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Face-to-face examination within 45 days before prescription
- [ ] 7-element WOPD completed before delivery
- [ ] Statement that captain's chair adequate (no separate positioning/skin protection cushion needed) (Under Review - High Confidence)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format per NY Medicaid requirements
- [ ] On-site home evaluation completed before delivery
- [ ] Attestation of no financial relationship with supplier

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Separate cushion needed but captain's chair ordered"** - Documentation indicates beneficiary needs pressure relief cushion or positioning cushion, but captain's chair code submitted. Fix: If separate cushion needed, order K0813 (sling/solid seat) with appropriate cushion code (E2601-E2625 series); captain's chair not appropriate when separate cushion required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Manual wheelchair not ruled out"** - F2F documentation insufficient regarding inability to self-propel manual wheelchair. Fix: Document specific UE limitations preventing manual wheelchair propulsion.

3. **"Insufficient MRADL documentation"** - Medical necessity does not clearly demonstrate MRADL impairment. Fix: Specifically document impaired MRADLs and how power mobility improves function.

4. **"Home assessment missing"** - Required home assessment not documented. Fix: Complete on-site assessment with measurements. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"DPD not signed"** - Detailed Product Description not signed before delivery. Fix: Obtain prescriber signature on DPD before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document that beneficiary does not require separate positioning or skin protection cushion
- Explain why captain's chair is appropriate (e.g., "Patient has intact skin, good postural stability, no positioning needs beyond general seating") *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If any pressure ulcer history or positioning needs, consider K0813 with separate cushion instead
- Complete thorough F2F with specific UE functional limitations
- Ensure 7-element WOPD complete before delivery
- Work with supplier for DPD signature before delivery

**Medicaid:**
- Verify current prior approval requirements via eMedNY (Under Review - High Confidence)
- Request home assessment promptly
- Document progression through mobility aid hierarchy (Under Review - High Confidence)
- Allow 30-60 days for delivery after approval
