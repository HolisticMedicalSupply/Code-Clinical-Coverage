# K0826 - Group 2 Very Heavy Duty PWC (Sling/Solid, 451-600 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

K0826 is a Group 2 very heavy duty power wheelchair for beneficiaries weighing 451-600 pounds (minimum 428 lbs per 95% rule). Very heavy duty construction accommodates morbid obesity with extremely reinforced frame and components. Combines Group 2 enhanced performance with very heavy duty weight capacity. **PA REQUIRED.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All standard Group 2 PWC criteria
- **Patient weight 428-600 lbs**: 95% rule allows minimum 428 lbs (95% of 450) up to 600 lbs maximum
- Must justify weight capacity need with actual patient weight exceeding 450 lbs
- Morbid obesity typically documented
- Group 2 performance justification
- Does not meet POV criteria

**Documentation:**
- PA REQUIRED
- F2F within 45 days
- **Actual patient weight prominently documented**: Must be 428-600 lbs
- **Detailed weight justification**: Why very heavy duty (>450 lbs capacity) needed
- Group 2 justification (see K0820)
- 7-Element WOPD
- ICD-10 codes for morbid obesity (E66.01, E66.2) and BMI (Z68.4x)

**Notes:**
- If weight <428 lbs: Use K0824-K0825 (heavy duty, 301-450 lbs)
- If weight >600 lbs: Use K0828-K0829 (extra heavy duty, 601+ lbs)
- Capped rental: 13 months

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

**Requirements:**
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Patient weight documentation showing need for capacity >450 lbs
- Group 2 capabilities medically justified or payment based on Group 1
- All heavy duty documentation requirements

## Prescription Checklist

- [ ] All Group 2 PWC requirements
- [ ] **Patient weight 428-600 lbs** documented
- [ ] ICD-10 codes: Morbid obesity (E66.01 or E66.2) and BMI (Z68.4x)
- [ ] Weight justification (actual weight exceeds 450 lbs)
- [ ] Group 2 justification
- [ ] PA approved

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient weight outside range"** - Weight <428 lbs or >600 lbs. Fix: If <428 lbs, use K0824-K0825. If >600 lbs, use K0828-K0829. Document actual weight prominently.

2. **"Very heavy duty not justified"** - Documentation doesn't explain why 451-600 lb capacity needed vs 301-450 lb. Fix: Document actual patient weight exceeds 450 lbs and requires very heavy duty reinforced construction. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Group 2 not justified"** - See K0820 for Group 2 justification guidance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

- **Document weight in multiple places**: F2F exam, prescription, PA request
- Use morbid obesity ICD-10 codes (E66.01, E66.2) in addition to mobility diagnosis
- Explain very heavy duty need: "Patient weight of [X] lbs exceeds heavy duty capacity and requires very heavy duty reinforced frame rated for 451-600 lbs" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include all Group 2 justification per K0820
- Submit PA before ordering

## Related Codes

- **K0827** - Group 2 Very Heavy Duty, Captain's Chair
