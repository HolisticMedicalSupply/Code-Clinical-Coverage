# K0824 - Group 2 Heavy Duty Power Wheelchair (Sling/Solid, 301-450 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

K0824 is a Group 2 heavy duty power wheelchair designed for beneficiaries weighing 301-450 pounds (minimum 285 lbs per 95% rule). Heavy duty wheelchairs have reinforced components including braces, bars, upholstery, motors, and gears to accommodate higher weight capacities. This code combines Group 2 enhanced performance capabilities with heavy duty construction. **Prior authorization REQUIRED.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All standard Group 2 PWC criteria (see K0820)
- **Patient weight 285-450 pounds**: Medicare 95% rule allows coverage starting at 285 lbs (95% of 300 lb threshold) up to maximum 450 lbs
- Must justify Group 2 enhanced performance vs Group 1
- Heavy duty construction needed due to patient weight
- Does not meet POV criteria
- Sling/solid seat/back

**Technical Specifications:**
- Group 2 performance: speed ≥4.5 MPH, range ≥12 miles, obstacle ≥60mm
- Weight capacity: 301-450 pounds (minimum 285 lbs per 95% rule)
- Reinforced frame and components
- Heavy duty motors and gears

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **PA REQUIRED** before delivery
- F2F within 45 days
- **Actual patient weight documented**: Must be within 285-450 lb range
- **Weight capacity justification**: Detailed narrative explaining why heavy duty needed
- **If weight outside 285-450 lb range**: Claim denied as not medically necessary
- Group 2 justification (why Group 1 insufficient - see K0820)
- 7-Element WOPD
- DPD signed before delivery
- Home assessment

**Important Notes:**
- **95% Rule**: Medicare allows coverage when patient weight is ≥95% of lower threshold (285 lbs) or ≤450 lbs maximum
- If patient weight <285 lbs: Use K0820-K0823 (standard Group 2, up to 300 lbs capacity)
- If patient weight >450 lbs: Use K0826-K0827 (very heavy duty, 451-600 lbs)
- Capped rental: 13 months
- PA approval required before proceeding

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare
- **Heavy duty covered when**: Patient >250 lbs OR severe spasticity OR body measurements cannot be accommodated by standard
- Group 2 capabilities must be medically justified or payment based on Group 1

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Fiscal order
- Patient weight documented (actual weight in pounds)
- Body measurements if applicable
- Group 2 justification
- Home assessment
- No financial relationship with supplier

**Important Notes:**
- NY Medicaid threshold is >250 lbs (different from Medicare 285 lb minimum)
- Can also qualify with severe spasticity even if weight <250 lbs
- Can qualify if body measurements exceed standard chair dimensions

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All standard Group 2 PWC requirements (see K0820)
- [ ] **Patient weight documented**: Actual weight in pounds
- [ ] **Weight within 285-450 lb range** for Medicare (or >250 lbs for Medicaid)
- [ ] Heavy duty justification (weight requires reinforced construction)
- [ ] Group 2 performance justification
- [ ] ICD-10 including obesity code (E66.x) and BMI code (Z68.4x)
- [ ] PA submitted and approved

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Patient weight ≥285 lbs AND ≤450 lbs
- [ ] Detailed narrative documenting weight capacity need
- [ ] Group 2 enhanced performance justification (see K0820)
- [ ] F2F within 45 days
- [ ] 7-element WOPD

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Patient weight >250 lbs OR severe spasticity OR body measurements exceed standard
- [ ] Prior approval obtained
- [ ] Fiscal order
- [ ] Home assessment

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient weight outside covered range"** - Weight <285 lbs or >450 lbs for Medicare. Fix: If weight <285 lbs, use K0820-K0823 (standard Group 2, up to 300 lbs). If weight >450 lbs, use K0826-K0827 (very heavy duty, 451-600 lbs). Document actual patient weight prominently.

2. **"Weight not documented"** - Patient weight not included in medical records or prescription. Fix: Document actual patient weight in pounds in F2F exam and prescription.

3. **"Group 2 not justified"** - Insufficient documentation why Group 2 needed vs Group 1. Fix: See K0820 for detailed Group 2 justification guidance (environmental factors, enhanced performance needs for MRADLs). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Heavy duty not justified"** - Documentation doesn't explain why heavy duty construction needed. Fix: Explain that patient weight requires reinforced frame, motors, gears to safely support weight during mobility. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"PA not obtained"** - Order submitted without PA approval. Fix: Submit and obtain PA approval before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document weight prominently**: Include actual weight in multiple places (F2F exam, prescription, PA request)
- **Verify 95% rule compliance**: Weight must be ≥285 lbs (95% of 300) AND ≤450 lbs
- Use ICD-10 codes for obesity (E66.x) and BMI (Z68.4x) in addition to primary mobility diagnosis
- Explain heavy duty need: "Patient weight of [X] lbs requires reinforced frame, heavy duty motors, and reinforced components to safely support weight during mobility activities" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include Group 2 justification per K0820 guidance
- Submit PA before ordering

**Medicaid:**
- NY Medicaid uses >250 lb threshold (lower than Medicare 285 lb minimum)
- Can also qualify with severe spasticity or body measurements exceeding standard dimensions (even if weight <250 lbs)
- Emphasize medical justification for both heavy duty AND Group 2 capabilities
- Allow time for PA review and approval
