# K0828 - Group 2 Extra Heavy Duty PWC (Sling/Solid, 601+ lbs)

## Clinical Overview

K0828 is a Group 2 extra heavy duty power wheelchair for extreme weight capacity requirements - patient weight 601+ pounds (minimum 570 lbs per 95% rule). Represents the highest weight capacity tier for standard power wheelchairs. Requires extreme reinforcement and strongest justification. **PA REQUIRED.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All standard Group 2 PWC criteria
- **Patient weight ≥570 lbs**: 95% rule allows minimum 570 lbs (95% of 600) with no upper limit specified
- Must clearly document patient weight exceeding 600 lbs
- Medical necessity critical at this weight tier
- Group 2 performance justification
- Does not meet POV criteria

**Documentation:**
- **PA REQUIRED** - highest scrutiny
- F2F within 45 days
- **Extremely detailed weight documentation**: Actual patient weight prominently documented multiple times
- **Strong medical necessity justification**: Why extra heavy duty (>600 lbs capacity) required; safety considerations
- **Weight capacity verification**: Document chair specifications support patient weight
- Group 2 justification (see K0820)
- 7-Element WOPD
- ICD-10 codes: Morbid obesity (E66.01, E66.2) and extreme BMI codes (Z68.4x)

**Important Notes:**
- If weight <570 lbs: Use K0826-K0827 (very heavy duty, 451-600 lbs)
- Highest weight capacity tier - requires strongest justification
- Medical necessity heavily scrutinized
- Capped rental: 13 months

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

**Requirements:**
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Extreme weight documentation (>600 lbs)
- Highest scrutiny on medical necessity
- Group 2 capabilities medically justified or payment based on Group 1
- All heavy duty documentation requirements

## Prescription Checklist

- [ ] All Group 2 PWC requirements
- [ ] **Patient weight ≥570 lbs** documented (must exceed 600 lbs for optimal approval)
- [ ] ICD-10 codes: Morbid obesity (E66.01, E66.2) and extreme BMI (Z68.4x)
- [ ] **Extremely detailed weight justification**: Why >600 lb capacity essential
- [ ] Safety considerations documented (patient safety with extreme weight)
- [ ] Wheelchair weight capacity specifications documented
- [ ] Group 2 justification
- [ ] PA approved

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient weight does not require extra heavy duty capacity"** - Weight documented as <600 lbs or insufficient justification for >600 lb capacity. Fix: Document actual patient weight ≥600 lbs. If weight <570 lbs, use K0826-K0827 (very heavy duty, 451-600 lbs).

2. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Insufficient documentation for highest weight tier. Fix: Provide extremely detailed justification including safety considerations, why very heavy duty insufficient, wheelchair specifications supporting weight. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Weight capacity not verified"** - Wheelchair specifications not documented. Fix: Include manufacturer specifications showing wheelchair rated for patient's weight. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Group 2 not justified"** - See K0820 for Group 2 justification guidance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document weight extensively**: Include in multiple locations with actual measured weight
- **Strong medical necessity statement**: "Patient weight of [X] lbs exceeds very heavy duty capacity (600 lbs) and requires extra heavy duty reinforced construction. Safety requires wheelchair rated for patient's weight to prevent equipment failure and patient injury." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include wheelchair manufacturer specifications showing weight rating *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Use extreme BMI codes (Z68.4x) and morbid obesity codes (E66.01, E66.2)
- Address safety considerations explicitly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include all Group 2 justification per K0820
- Expect high scrutiny - be thorough
- Submit PA well in advance

**Medicaid:**
- Same requirements as Medicare
- Expect extended PA review time
- Medical necessity must be exceptionally strong

## Related Codes

- **K0826-K0827** - Group 2 Very Heavy Duty (451-600 lbs) - use if weight <570 lbs
- **K0829** - Group 2 Extra Heavy Duty, Captain's Chair (601+ lbs)
- **E66.01** - Morbid obesity (primary diagnosis)
- **E66.2** - Morbid obesity with alveolar hypoventilation
- **Z68.4x** - BMI codes (extreme values)
