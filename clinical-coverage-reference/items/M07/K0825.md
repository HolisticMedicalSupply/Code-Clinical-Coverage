# K0825 - Group 2 Heavy Duty PWC (Captain's Chair, 301-450 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

K0825 is identical to K0824 except with integrated captain's chair seat. Designed for beneficiaries weighing 285-450 pounds (per 95% rule) who need Group 2 performance and heavy duty construction, but do not require separate positioning or skin protection cushions. **PA REQUIRED.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All K0824 requirements (see K0824)
- **Captain's chair appropriate**: No separate positioning or skin protection cushion needed
- Patient weight 285-450 lbs

**Documentation:**
- All K0824 documentation requirements
- PA REQUIRED
- F2F within 45 days (correcting "6 months" error above - should be 45 days per PWC policy) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Statement captain's chair adequate (no separate cushion needed) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Notes:**
- If separate cushion needed, use K0824 + cushion code
- Captain's chair least costly if separate cushion not needed

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

**Requirements:**
- All K0824 requirements
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Heavy duty criteria: >250 lbs OR severe spasticity OR body measurements exceed standard
- Captain's chair restrictions apply

## Prescription Checklist

- [ ] All K0824 requirements (see K0824)
- [ ] Captain's chair appropriate (no separate positioning/skin cushion needed)
- [ ] Patient weight 285-450 lbs (Medicare) or >250 lbs (Medicaid)
- [ ] PA approved

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Separate cushion needed"** - Use K0824 + cushion code if positioning/skin protection cushion required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **"Patient weight outside range"** - See K0824 for weight range requirements.
3. **"Group 2 not justified"** - See K0820/K0824 for Group 2 justification guidance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

- Follow K0824 guidance for weight documentation and Group 2 justification
- Document captain's chair appropriateness (no positioning/skin protection needs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If any pressure ulcer history or positioning needs, consider K0824 + separate cushion
