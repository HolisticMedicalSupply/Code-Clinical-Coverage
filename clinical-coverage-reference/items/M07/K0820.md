# K0820 - Group 2 Standard Power Wheelchair (Portable, Sling/Solid Seat)

## Clinical Overview

K0820 is a Group 2 standard power wheelchair with portable design and sling or solid seat/back. Group 2 wheelchairs provide enhanced capabilities beyond Group 1, including higher speed (≥4.5 MPH vs ≥3 MPH), greater range (≥12 miles vs ≥5 miles), and improved obstacle climbing (≥60mm vs ≥20mm). These enhanced features are appropriate for beneficiaries with active lifestyles, longer daily wheelchair use, or demanding home/community environments requiring superior performance. **Prior authorization is REQUIRED** for all Group 2 power wheelchairs.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All standard power wheelchair requirements (mobility limitation impairing MRADLs, insufficient UE function for manual wheelchair, cannot use cane/walker)
- **Enhanced performance justification**: Must document why Group 1 insufficient, such as:
  - Need for greater speed/range to accomplish MRADLs in home/community
  - Demanding terrain requiring enhanced obstacle climbing
  - Active wheelchair use requiring higher performance
  - Longer distances traveled daily for MRADLs
- Does not meet POV criteria (unable to operate tiller OR cannot maintain postural stability in scooter)
- Patient weight ≤300 pounds
- Portable design needed (largest component ≤55 lbs)

**Technical Specifications:**
- Length ≤48 inches (vs ≤40" for Group 1)
- Width ≤34 inches (vs ≤24" for Group 1)
- Speed ≥4.5 MPH (vs ≥3 MPH for Group 1)
- Range ≥12 miles (vs ≥5 miles for Group 1)
- Obstacle climbing ≥60mm (vs ≥20mm for Group 1)
- Stability ≥7.5 degrees
- Portable: largest component ≤55 lbs

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED**: Submit PA before delivery; review within 7 calendar days
- F2F exam within 45 days with comprehensive mobility assessment
- **Detailed justification** explaining why Group 1 insufficient:
  - Specific MRADLs requiring enhanced speed/range
  - Environmental factors (terrain, distances, community access needs)
  - Daily wheelchair use patterns requiring superior performance
- 7-Element WOPD
- DPD signed before delivery
- Home assessment
- Delivery within 120 days of F2F OR 6 months if PA/ADMC approved

**Important Notes:**
- Capped rental REQUIRED: 13 months to ownership
- No specialty evaluation or ATP required for Group 2 (unlike Group 3+)
- PA approval required before proceeding with order
- Denial risk higher for Group 2 without clear justification over Group 1

**References:**
- Medicare LCD L33789 (Power Mobility Devices)
- CMS Prior Authorization List (2025)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare
- **Group 2 capabilities must be medically justified OR payment will be based on Group 1**

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Fiscal order
- F2F evaluation
- **Strong justification for Group 2 capabilities**: Environmental factors, activity level, specific MRADL needs requiring enhanced performance
- Home assessment
- No financial relationship with supplier

**Important Notes:**
- Verify current authorization requirements via eMedNY system (Under Review - High Confidence)
- If Group 2 justification insufficient, Medicaid may pay at Group 1 rate
- Home AND community use
- Delivery within 60 days after approval typically

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis codes
- [ ] MRADL impairment documentation
- [ ] Insufficient UE function for manual wheelchair
- [ ] Cane/walker ruled out
- [ ] POV ruled out (cannot operate tiller OR cannot maintain postural stability)
- [ ] Patient weight ≤300 lbs
- [ ] **Detailed Group 2 justification**: Why Group 1 insufficient
- [ ] Safe operation capability
- [ ] Signature, date, NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Prior authorization submitted and approved**
- [ ] F2F within 45 days
- [ ] 7-element WOPD
- [ ] Specific examples of MRADLs requiring enhanced performance
- [ ] Environmental assessment (terrain, distances, community access)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **Prior approval obtained**
- [ ] Fiscal order
- [ ] Strong medical justification for Group 2 capabilities
- [ ] Home assessment arranged

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Group 2 capabilities not medically justified"** - Most common denial. Insufficient documentation explaining why Group 1 inadequate. Fix: Provide specific examples such as "Patient travels 0.8 miles round trip to mailbox daily for MRADL; Group 1 range of 5 miles insufficient for this plus indoor mobility; requires Group 2 range of 12+ miles" or "Home has 2-inch door thresholds and steep outdoor ramp gradient; Group 1 obstacle capability of 20mm insufficient; requires Group 2 capability of 60mm." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"POV not ruled out"** - Documentation does not explain why scooter (POV) inappropriate. Fix: State "Patient cannot operate tiller controls due to limited UE function" OR "Patient cannot maintain postural stability required for scooter seating."

3. **"Manual wheelchair not ruled out"** - Insufficient UE limitation documentation. Fix: Document specific UE functional limitations preventing manual wheelchair propulsion.

4. **"Prior authorization not obtained"** - Order submitted without PA approval. Fix: Submit and obtain PA approval before delivery.

5. **"Environmental factors not documented"** - Justification vague. Fix: Include specific measurements (distances traveled, terrain type, obstacle heights) and how they necessitate Group 2 capabilities. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Submit PA first**: Do not proceed without PA approval
- **Be specific** in Group 2 justification:
  - Measure distances traveled for MRADLs
  - Document terrain challenges (gravel, grass, thresholds, ramps)
  - Describe daily activity patterns requiring enhanced performance
- Include environmental assessment photos if possible (helpful but not required) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Compare Group 1 vs Group 2 specs in justification: "Group 1 obstacle capability 20mm insufficient for home's 50mm door thresholds" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Consider whether POV might be appropriate; if not, clearly document why

**Medicaid:**
- Strong medical justification critical to avoid Group 1 payment rate
- Emphasize MRADL needs (not convenience or preference)
- Document environmental factors unique to patient's home/community
- Allow extended timeline for PA review and approval
- Verify specific authorization requirements via eMedNY (Under Review - High Confidence)
