# K0813 - Group 1 Standard Power Wheelchair (Portable, Sling/Solid Seat)

## Clinical Overview

K0813 is a Group 1 standard power wheelchair with portable design, featuring a sling or solid seat and back. Group 1 wheelchairs provide basic power mobility for beneficiaries who cannot self-propel a manual wheelchair due to insufficient upper extremity function but do not require the enhanced capabilities of Group 2 or higher wheelchairs. The portable design means the largest component weighs 55 pounds or less for transport purposes.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Mobility limitation significantly impairs Mobility-Related Activities of Daily Living (MRADLs) in home or community
- Insufficient upper extremity function to self-propel manual wheelchair during typical activities throughout the day
- Cannot safely ambulate with cane or walker
- Cognitive and physical ability to safely operate power wheelchair OR caregiver available, willing, and able to assist
- Patient weight up to and including 300 pounds
- No need for Group 2+ enhanced performance features (speed, range, obstacle climbing)

**Technical Specifications:**
- Length ≤40 inches
- Width ≤24 inches
- Speed ≥3 MPH
- Range ≥5 miles per charge
- Obstacle climbing ≥20mm
- Portable: largest component ≤55 pounds

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **Face-to-face examination** within 45 days before prescription with comprehensive mobility assessment
- **7-Element Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD)** including: (1) beneficiary name, (2) item description, (3) F2F exam date, (4) diagnoses/conditions, (5) length of need, (6) prescriber signature, (7) date signed
- **Detailed Product Description (DPD)** from supplier; prescriber must sign before delivery
- **Home Assessment** conducted on-site before or at delivery verifying adequate access, maneuvering space, door widths, floor surfaces, and secure storage
- Medical record documentation explaining why cane/walker insufficient, why manual wheelchair insufficient (specifically UE limitations), and safe operation capability
- Delivery must occur within 120 days of F2F completion

**Important Notes:**
- **Capped rental REQUIRED**: Cannot purchase outright; must rent for 13 months (months 1-3: 15% of purchase price monthly, months 4-13: 6% of purchase price monthly); ownership transfers to beneficiary after 13th payment
- **No specialty evaluation required**: Unlike K0005, K0008, or K0013, Group 1 power wheelchairs do not require specialty PT/OT evaluation
- **No RESNA ATP required**: Standard supplier qualifications sufficient for Group 1
- **No prior authorization required**: Group 1 wheelchairs are not on the CMS prior authorization list (only Group 2-5 require PA as of 2025)
- Reasonable useful lifetime: 5 years; replacement earlier only for loss, theft, irreparable damage, or significant change in patient condition

- Medicare NCD 280.3 (Mobility Assistive Equipment)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same clinical criteria as Medicare
- Sequential evaluation required: cane → walker → manual wheelchair → POV → power wheelchair (must demonstrate insufficiency of each prior level) (Under Review - High Confidence)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Fiscal order from qualified licensed practitioner
- Face-to-face evaluation documenting mobility assessment
- On-site home evaluation REQUIRED documenting:
  - Adequate access to and within home
  - Door widths sufficient for wheelchair passage
  - Appropriate floor surfaces (not thick carpet that impedes mobility)
  - Secure storage space for wheelchair and charging
- Prescriber must have NO financial relationship with supplier (attestation required)
- PT/OT evaluation recommended but not required for Group 1 (Under Review - High Confidence)

**Important Notes:**
- Coverage for home AND/OR community use (updated February 2021 NY Medicaid policy)
- Prior approval may be required; verify current requirements via eMedNY system (Under Review - High Confidence)
- Delivery timeframes: 30 days for standard items, 60 days for customized items
- Reasonable useful lifetime: 5 years (Under Review - High Confidence)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. No regional variations in coverage policies between Brooklyn and Nassau County; both follow uniform NY State Medicaid wheelchair policies.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting mobility limitation
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting MRADL impairment
- [ ] Documentation of insufficient UE function for manual wheelchair self-propulsion
- [ ] Statement that cane/walker insufficient
- [ ] Patient weight (must be ≤300 lbs for K0813)
- [ ] Safe operation capability OR caregiver availability
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number
- [ ] Length of need (typically "lifetime" for chronic conditions)

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Face-to-face examination within 45 days before prescription
- [ ] F2F exam date documented in medical record
- [ ] Comprehensive mobility assessment including MRADL limitations
- [ ] Physical exam: weight, ROM, strength, posture, balance
- [ ] Home environment assessment (access, doorways, surfaces)
- [ ] 7-element WOPD completed before delivery

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order format per NY Medicaid requirements
- [ ] On-site home evaluation completed before delivery
- [ ] Attestation that prescriber has no financial relationship with supplier
- [ ] Sequential evaluation documentation showing cane/walker/manual wheelchair insufficient (Under Review - High Confidence)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Manual wheelchair not ruled out"** - Face-to-face documentation does not sufficiently explain why beneficiary cannot self-propel manual wheelchair. Fix: Document specific upper extremity limitations (strength, ROM, endurance, pain) preventing manual wheelchair propulsion throughout typical day. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient MRADL documentation"** - Medical necessity does not clearly demonstrate impairment of MRADLs. Fix: Specifically document which MRADLs are impaired (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, bathing) and how power mobility will improve function.

3. **"Home assessment missing or incomplete"** - Required home assessment not documented. Fix: Complete on-site assessment documenting adequate access, doorway widths, floor surfaces, and secure storage with measurements. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Delivery outside 120-day window"** - Delivery occurred more than 120 days after F2F exam. Fix: Ensure delivery within 120 days of F2F or obtain new F2F exam.

5. **"DPD not signed by prescriber"** - Detailed Product Description not signed before delivery. Fix: Supplier must provide DPD and obtain prescriber signature before delivery to beneficiary.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Conduct thorough face-to-face exam within 45 days; document date prominently
- Use specific measurements and functional assessments (e.g., "MMT shows bilateral UE strength 3/5, unable to propel manual wheelchair >10 feet without significant fatigue")
- Document specific MRADL limitations (e.g., "Unable to access bathroom independently; requires 45+ minutes to cross room with walker")
- Include home assessment findings in medical record
- Ensure 7-element WOPD is complete before delivery
- Work with supplier to obtain and sign DPD before delivery

**Medicaid:**
- Request home assessment be scheduled promptly after prescription
- Document progression through mobility aids (cane inadequate due to X, walker inadequate due to Y, manual wheelchair inadequate due to Z) (Under Review - High Confidence)
- Verify prescriber has no financial relationship with supplier
- Check eMedNY portal for current prior approval requirements before ordering (Under Review - High Confidence)
- Allow 30-60 days for delivery after approval
