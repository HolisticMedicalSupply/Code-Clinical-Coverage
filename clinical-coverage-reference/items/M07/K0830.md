# K0830 - Group 2 Power Wheelchair with Seat Elevator (Sling/Solid, ≤300 lbs)

## Clinical Overview

K0830 is a Group 2 standard power wheelchair with integrated seat elevation system. Combines Group 2 enhanced performance with power seat elevation capability. Requires dual justification: (1) Group 2 enhanced performance for mobility, AND (2) seat elevation for specific medical/functional needs such as transfers, reach, safety, communication, or vocational/educational goals. **PA REQUIRED.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- **All standard Group 2 PWC criteria** (see K0820)
- **PLUS separate seat elevation justification** for one or more of:
  - **Transfers**: Seat elevation improves transfer safety/independence
  - **Reach requirements**: Need to access items at counter height, shelves, etc. for MRADLs
  - **Safety**: Elevation needed for visibility, interaction at eye level
  - **Communication**: Face-to-face interaction requiring elevation
  - **Vocational/educational goals**: Work or school activities requiring elevation
- Ability to safely operate seat elevation feature (cognitive and physical capability)
- Adequate home environment for elevated position (ceiling height, space clearance)
- Patient weight ≤300 pounds

**Technical Specifications:**
- Group 2 performance: speed ≥4.5 MPH, range ≥12 miles, obstacle ≥60mm
- Power seat elevation system
- Sling/solid seat/back

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **PA REQUIRED** before delivery
- F2F within 45 days
- **Dual justification**:
  1. Group 2 enhanced performance justification (see K0820)
  2. **Seat elevation justification**: Specific medical necessity for elevation function with detailed examples
- Document specific activities requiring elevation (e.g., "Patient needs to access kitchen counters at 36" height for meal preparation MRADL; standard seated height inadequate")
- Document safe operation capability
- Home assessment verifying adequate ceiling height and clearance for elevation
- 7-Element WOPD
- DPD signed before delivery

**Important Notes:**
- **E2300 code** used for seat elevation on complex rehab power wheelchairs (Group 3+), NOT K0830/K0831
- K0830/K0831 are for Group 2 standard wheelchairs with integrated elevation
- Gap-filling pricing may apply (non-contract pricing) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Capped rental: 13 months
- Not separately billable at initial issue *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- PA approval required before ordering

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- All Group 2 PWC criteria
- Group 2 capabilities must be medically justified or payment based on Group 1
- **Seat elevation must have separate medical justification** beyond basic mobility needs

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Fiscal order
- Dual justification (Group 2 + seat elevation)
- Home assessment must verify adequate ceiling height and space for elevation
- Safe operation capability documented
- No financial relationship with supplier

**Important Notes:**
- Seat elevation needs must be functional/medical, not convenience
- Environmental assessment critical (ceiling heights, doorways when elevated) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All standard Group 2 PWC requirements (see K0820)
- [ ] **Group 2 justification** (enhanced performance needs)
- [ ] **Seat elevation justification**: Specific medical necessity
- [ ] Detailed examples of activities requiring elevation
- [ ] Safe operation capability documented
- [ ] Home environment assessment (ceiling height, clearances)
- [ ] Patient weight ≤300 lbs
- [ ] PA submitted and approved

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] F2F within 45 days with dual justification
- [ ] Specific MRADL examples requiring elevation (meal prep at counter height, accessing shelves, etc.)
- [ ] Document why elevation essential vs alternative solutions
- [ ] 7-element WOPD

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Prior approval obtained
- [ ] Fiscal order
- [ ] Home assessment verifying adequate ceiling height/space

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Seat elevation not medically necessary"** - Most common denial. Insufficient justification for elevation function beyond basic mobility. Fix: Provide specific examples such as "Patient prepares meals independently as MRADL; requires counter access at 36" height; standard seated height of 18-20" inadequate; seat elevation to 34-36" enables safe meal preparation without transfers or assistance" or "Patient works from home; requires desk/computer access at standard 29" height; seat elevation enables independent vocational activity." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Alternative solutions not ruled out"** - Documentation doesn't explain why alternatives inadequate (e.g., lowered counters, reaching aids). Fix: Document why alternatives not feasible or insufficient for patient's specific situation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Home environment not adequate"** - Ceiling height or space insufficient for elevation. Fix: Document actual ceiling heights (typically need 8'+ ceilings) and clearances in home assessment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Safe operation not documented"** - No documentation of ability to safely operate elevation. Fix: Document cognitive and physical capability to safely control elevation function without risk. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Group 2 not justified"** - Insufficient Group 2 enhanced performance justification. Fix: See K0820 for detailed Group 2 justification guidance.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Be extremely specific** in seat elevation justification with real-world examples
- Use measurements: "Kitchen counter at 36" height; patient seated height 19"; elevation to 35" enables safe counter access"
- Describe specific MRADLs or vocational tasks requiring elevation
- Document alternatives considered and why insufficient: "Lowering counters not feasible in rental property; reaching aids unsafe for patient with limited UE function" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include home assessment measurements (ceiling heights, doorway heights, room dimensions)
- Address safety: "Patient demonstrates safe operation of elevation controls; cognitive function intact; understands elevation limitations"
- Include all Group 2 justification per K0820
- Submit PA well in advance

**Medicaid:**
- Emphasize functional/medical necessity (not convenience or preference)
- Home assessment documentation critical
- Verify ceiling heights adequate (typically 8'+ minimum) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document how elevation enables specific MRADLs
