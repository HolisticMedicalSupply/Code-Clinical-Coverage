# K0013 - Custom Motorized/Power Wheelchair Base

## Clinical Overview

K0013 is for truly custom-fabricated power wheelchair bases when standard modular power wheelchairs (including all Group 1-5 options with accessories) cannot accommodate the patient's unique body proportions, deformities, or positioning needs. Requires individual frame construction from custom measurements. Represents highest level of complexity and documentation for power wheelchairs. **ADMC (Advance Determination of Medicare Coverage) STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.** Requires specialty PT/OT evaluation and RESNA ATP involvement.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Complex neurological or musculoskeletal conditions
- **Standard/modular PWC bases inadequate**: Must prove that ALL standard Group 1-5 wheelchairs with available modular accessories cannot meet needs
- **True custom fabrication required**: Frame must be individually constructed from patient-specific measurements (not just modified from standard)
- Complex body geometry, severe contractures, or skeletal deformities
- Unique medical needs requiring custom construction
- MRADL impairment requiring power mobility
- Meets Group 3+ performance criteria typically

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **ADMC (Advance Determination of Medicare Coverage) STRONGLY RECOMMENDED**: Submit ADMC request before ordering to get binding coverage decision
- **PT/OT SPECIALTY EVALUATION REQUIRED**:
  - Must be LCMP (Licensed Certified Medicare Practitioner) - PT or OT
  - Must have specific wheelchair expertise
  - Must have NO financial relationship with supplier (signed attestation required)
  - Comprehensive evaluation documenting patient's unique needs
- **RESNA ATP REQUIRED**:
  - Supplier must employ RESNA-certified Assistive Technology Professional
  - ATP must have direct involvement in evaluation and specification
- **Comprehensive documentation**:
  - Detailed measurements: Multiple body segment measurements showing unique proportions
  - **Why modular inadequate**: Specific documentation explaining why each relevant Group code + available modular components cannot accommodate patient
  - **Custom frame justification**: Prove true custom fabrication (not just assembly of components)
  - Medical conditions requiring customization
  - Specific custom features needed and medical justification for each
- F2F within 45 days
- 7-Element WOPD
- DPD signed before delivery
- Home assessment

**Important Notes:**
- **ADMC strongly recommended** - provides binding coverage determination before costly custom fabrication
- **Delivery timeline**: Within 6 months if ADMC approval received (vs 120 days standard)
- **Capped rental NOT required**: May be rented OR purchased (beneficiary choice) - unlike standard PWCs that must be rented
- **Very high scrutiny**: Medicare carefully reviews custom designation to prevent misuse
- **Custom vs. Modular**: Must prove true custom fabrication, not just high-end modular assembly
- One wheelchair at a time
- Meets Group 3+ criteria plus customization

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare
- Must prove modular power wheelchairs inadequate

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED**
- Prior approval REQUIRED
- Fiscal order
- **Comprehensive PT/OT evaluation** with wheelchair expertise required
- **RESNA ATP involvement** required
- Detailed custom specifications with patient-specific measurements
- Documentation why modular systems inadequate
- No financial relationship with supplier (evaluator)

**Important Notes:**
- Very high scrutiny - must prove true custom fabrication necessary
- Extended approval timeline expected
- May require additional reviews or justifications

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] **Complex diagnosis** requiring custom construction
- [ ] **Comprehensive PT/OT specialty evaluation** by LCMP with wheelchair expertise, no financial relationship with supplier
- [ ] **RESNA ATP evaluation** and direct involvement documented
- [ ] **Detailed body measurements**: Multiple segments showing unique proportions
- [ ] **Documentation why ALL modular options inadequate**: Specific review of relevant Group codes and available components
- [ ] **Custom frame justification**: Prove individual construction required
- [ ] **Specific custom features list** with medical justification for each
- [ ] ICD-10 codes for complex conditions
- [ ] Signature, date, NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **ADMC request submitted** (strongly recommended)
- [ ] F2F within 45 days with complex evaluation
- [ ] PT/OT attestation of no financial relationship with supplier
- [ ] RESNA ATP certification documented
- [ ] 7-element WOPD
- [ ] Allow 6-month timeline for delivery

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization obtained
- [ ] Prior approval obtained
- [ ] Fiscal order
- [ ] PT/OT with wheelchair expertise
- [ ] RESNA ATP documented

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Modular components adequate"** - Most common denial. Documentation doesn't adequately prove modular systems insufficient. Fix: Systematically review relevant Group codes (e.g., "Group 3 chair K0848 with available modular seating components E2603, E2606, E2613 inadequate due to patient's unique torso angle of 35° requiring custom seat-to-back junction not available in modular options; patient's hip width of 24" exceeds maximum modular width of 22""). Include actual measurements vs. available modular specifications. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Not truly custom fabrication"** - Chair appears to be high-end modular assembly rather than individual custom construction. Fix: Clearly distinguish custom frame elements from modular: "Frame requires individual welding of seat rail at patient-specific 35° angle; custom tube bending for back support geometry; individual construction not available as modular component." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"PT/OT evaluation inadequate"** - Evaluation doesn't meet specialty requirements. Fix: Ensure evaluator is LCMP (PT/OT), has wheelchair expertise (document qualifications), has NO financial relationship with supplier (signed attestation), and provides comprehensive documentation.

4. **"RESNA ATP not documented"** - ATP involvement not proven. Fix: Include ATP credentials, certification number, and document direct involvement in evaluation and specification process.

5. **"ADMC not obtained"** - For Medicare, ordering without ADMC for custom chair. Fix: Submit ADMC request with complete documentation before ordering (strongly recommended to avoid denial after fabrication).

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Submit ADMC before ordering**: Obtain binding coverage determination before costly custom fabrication begins
- **Invest in comprehensive evaluation**: Detailed PT/OT specialty evaluation is critical
- **Be systematic in ruling out modular**: Create table comparing patient measurements vs. available modular specifications for relevant chairs
- **Use specific measurements**: "Patient's sitting depth 12", trunk width 24", hip angle 110°" vs. "Patient has unusual proportions"
- **Document custom fabrication**: "Frame requires individual welding at patient-specific angles not available in any modular system; custom tube bending for [specific component]; individual construction of [element]"
- **Include photos/diagrams**: Visual documentation helpful (if possible) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify evaluator credentials**: PT/OT with wheelchair expertise, LCMP status, no financial relationship with supplier
- **Verify ATP credentials**: RESNA certification current, ATP number included
- **Allow extended timeline**: ADMC review + custom fabrication + approval = 6+ months
- **Consider consultation**: Given complexity, consider manufacturer rep involvement in specification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- Follow Medicare guidance above
- Obtain DVS authorization early in process
- Expect multiple review rounds
- Be prepared for extensive documentation requests
- Allow significant lead time (6+ months) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
