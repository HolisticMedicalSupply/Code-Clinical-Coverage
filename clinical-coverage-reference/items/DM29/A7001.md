# A7001 - Reusable Suction Pump Collection Canister

## Clinical Overview

A7001 represents a non-disposable (reusable) collection canister used with various suction pump systems, including external urine management pumps (E2001), respiratory suction pumps, and wound drainage systems. The canister collects fluids drawn through suction tubing, typically with 2000cc capacity and should be emptied before reaching 1800cc *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. This is a component accessory for PureWick and similar external urine management systems, formalized by CMS effective April 1, 2023.

**⚠️ COVERAGE DIFFERENCE: Medicare does NOT cover A7001. NY Medicaid DOES cover A7001 (direct bill, no prior authorization).**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: NOT COVERED**

**Rationale:**
- Pre-existing code formalized April 1, 2023 for non-disposable collection canisters
- Not addressed in LCD L33612 (Suction Pumps) - L33612 only covers E2000 (gastric), E0600 (respiratory), K0743 (wound) suction pumps
- Not covered under LCD L33803 (Urological Supplies)
- PDAC contractor published coding guidance for billing canister separately from pump (effective April 1, 2023)
- Medicare does not reimburse A7001 without formal LCD coverage criteria

**Cash Payment Information:**
- Cash purchase required for Medicare beneficiaries
- No documentation requirements, modifiers, or frequency limitations established due to non-covered status
- Pricing varies by supplier *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Clinical Indications (if coverage were available):**
- Collection canister for E2001 external urine management pump
- Respiratory secretion collection with E0600 respiratory suction pumps *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Wound drainage collection with wound therapy pumps *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct bill** - No prior authorization required
- **No DVS authorization required**

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Prescription required documenting medical necessity for suction collection system
- Specify pump type: urinary (E2001), respiratory (E0600), or wound system *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting suction pump use

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Quantity limit: **30 units per billing period** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency: Monthly supply allowance *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Reusable canisters may have longer replacement cycle than disposable *(Under Review)*

**Reimbursement:**
- Fee not explicitly listed on NY Medicaid DME Fee Schedule (effective 7/1/2016)
- A7000 (disposable canister) listed at $4.35 for reference *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Contact eMedNY for current reimbursement rate: (800) 343-9000 *(Under Review)*

**Special Notes:**
- Standard DME billing - not part of NYRx pharmacy transition
- Used with various suction pump systems (respiratory, wound, urinary)
- CMS designated A7001 for PureWick canister component effective 4/1/2023
- No age restrictions identified

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill without prior authorization.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**For Medicare (Cash Pay):**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement
- [ ] Specify suction pump type
- [ ] Inform patient of cash pay requirement

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting suction pump need
- [ ] Medical necessity statement for suction collection system
- [ ] Specify associated pump code: E2001 (urinary), E0600 (respiratory), or other *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

**Medicare:**
1. **"Code not covered under Medicare benefit"** - Expected. No LCD coverage exists. All Medicare claims will deny. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix (Medicare):** Inform patient of cash pay requirement. Do not submit Medicare claims.

**NY Medicaid:**
1. **"Pump not covered"** - If billing A7001 for E2001 pump use, be aware E2001 pump itself not yet covered by NY Medicaid. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix (Medicaid):** Verify associated pump is covered before ordering canister. A7001 is covered for respiratory/wound suction but pump must also be authorized.

2. **"Quantity exceeds limit"** - Billing more than 30 units per month. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix (Medicaid):** Bill 30 units maximum per billing period. Document if higher quantity medically necessary for prior approval.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Not applicable - code not covered by Medicare *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Inform patient upfront of cash pay requirement
- Provide cost estimate before ordering

**NY Medicaid:**
- Direct bill - no prior authorization needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Ensure prescription clearly documents medical necessity for suction system
- Include ICD-10 supporting diagnosis (incontinence for urinary, respiratory condition for respiratory suction, wound diagnosis for wound suction)
- Verify pump coverage before ordering canister accessory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill per unit (each canister), not per month *(Under Review)*

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Specify pump type and medical necessity clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For urinary use: document incontinence severity, failed alternatives, CAUTI risk *(Under Review)*
- For respiratory use: document secretion management need, tracheostomy care *(Under Review)*
- For wound use: document wound drainage requiring negative pressure collection *(Under Review)*
