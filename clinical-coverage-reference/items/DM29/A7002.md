# A7002 - Suction Pump Tubing

## Clinical Overview

A7002 represents tubing used with suction pump systems, including external urine management pumps (E2001), respiratory suction pumps (E0600), and wound drainage systems. This code includes pump tubing connecting the pump to the collection canister and collector tubing with elbow connector that connects external wicking catheters to the collection system. Pre-existing code formalized by CMS effective April 1, 2023 for PureWick and similar external urine management systems.

**⚠️ COVERAGE DIFFERENCE: Medicare does NOT cover A7002. NY Medicaid DOES cover A7002 at $0.92 per unit (direct bill, no prior authorization).**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: NOT COVERED**

**Rationale:**
- Pre-existing code formalized April 1, 2023 for suction pump tubing
- Not covered under LCD L33612 (Suction Pumps) - L33612 only addresses E2000 (gastric), E0600 (respiratory), K0743 (wound) pump equipment
- Not covered under LCD L33803 (Urological Supplies)
- PDAC contractor recognizes code for billing purposes and published coding instructions for PureWick system accessories
- Medicare does not provide reimbursement without formal LCD coverage criteria

**Cash Payment Information:**
- Cash purchase required for Medicare beneficiaries
- No WOPD requirement, prior authorization, or modifiers specified
- Pricing varies by supplier *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Typical cost: $5-15 per tubing set *(Under Review)*

**Clinical Indications (if coverage were available):**
- Replacement tubing for E2001 external urine management pump
- Respiratory secretion suction tubing for E0600 systems *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Wound drainage suction tubing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: COVERED**

**Authorization Requirements:**
- **Direct bill** - No prior authorization required
- **No DVS authorization required**

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician order required specifying medical necessity for suction system
- Specify pump type: urinary (E2001), respiratory (E0600), or wound system *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- ICD-10 diagnosis supporting suction pump use
- Document frequency of tubing replacement need *(Under Review)*

**Frequency & Quantity:**
- Fee: **$0.92 per unit** (NY Medicaid Fee Schedule effective 7/1/2016)
- Quantity limit: **30 units maximum per month**
- Frequency: Monthly supply allowance *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Billed per unit (each tubing piece), not per foot

**Billing Notes:**
- Standard DME billing - not part of NYRx pharmacy benefit transition
- Used with respiratory suction pumps, wound suction, and urinary suction systems
- No age restrictions documented
- CMS coding effective 4/1/2023 for PureWick and similar systems

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill at $0.92 per unit, maximum 30 units per month.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**For Medicare (Cash Pay):**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement
- [ ] Specify suction pump type and associated code
- [ ] Inform patient of cash pay requirement

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting suction pump need
- [ ] Medical necessity statement for suction collection system
- [ ] Specify associated pump code: E2001 (urinary), E0600 (respiratory), K0743 (wound), or other
- [ ] Quantity needed (maximum 30 units per month)
- [ ] Frequency of tubing replacement *(Under Review)*
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

**Medicare:**
1. **"Code not covered under Medicare benefit"** - Expected. No LCD coverage exists. All Medicare claims will deny. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix (Medicare):** Inform patient of cash pay requirement. Do not submit Medicare claims for A7002.

**NY Medicaid:**
1. **"Quantity exceeds maximum"** - Billing more than 30 units per month. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix (Medicaid):** Bill maximum 30 units per month. If higher quantity needed, document medical necessity and submit for prior approval. *(Under Review)*

2. **"Pump not covered"** - If billing A7002 for E2001 pump use, be aware E2001 pump itself not yet established in NY Medicaid system. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix (Medicaid):** Verify associated pump coverage before ordering tubing. A7002 is covered for respiratory/wound suction but pump must also be authorized.

3. **"Missing or invalid prescription"** - No physician order on file. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix (Medicaid):** Ensure prescription clearly specifies suction pump system and tubing need before billing.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Not applicable - code not covered by Medicare *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Inform patient upfront of cash pay requirement
- Provide cost estimate ($5-15 per set typical) before ordering *(Under Review)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Direct bill - no prior authorization needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill at $0.92 per unit (each tubing piece)
- Maximum 30 units per month allowed
- Ensure prescription specifies medical necessity for suction system
- Include ICD-10 supporting diagnosis matching pump indication

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Specify pump type and associated code clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document infection control rationale for replacement frequency *(Under Review)*
- For urinary use: document incontinence severity, CAUTI prevention need *(Under Review)*
- For respiratory use: document tracheostomy care, secretion management *(Under Review)*
- For wound use: document wound drainage requiring negative pressure *(Under Review)*

**Replacement Schedule Guidance:**
- Monthly replacement recommended for infection control *(Under Review)*
- Replace more frequently if visibly soiled or damaged *(Under Review)*
- Single-patient use only - do not reuse between patients *(Under Review)*
