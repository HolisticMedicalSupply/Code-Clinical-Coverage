# E2001 - External Urine Management Suction Pump

## Clinical Overview

E2001 represents an electric suction pump designed for home use with external urine and/or fecal management systems. The most common brand is the PureWick system *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. This device uses low-pressure suction to draw urine (or feces) away from the body through external wicking catheters, providing non-invasive incontinence management. The system reduces the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) compared to indwelling catheters while preserving skin integrity in immobile patients.

E2001 replaced temporary code K1006 effective January 1, 2024.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This code is NOT COVERED by Medicare (cash pay only). NY Medicaid has NOT YET ADOPTED this code. Cash payment required from all patients.**
