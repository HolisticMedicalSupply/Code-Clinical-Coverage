# A6591 - Reusable External Urinary Catheter (Monthly Supply)

## Clinical Overview

A6591 represents a monthly supply billing code for non-disposable/reusable external urinary catheters designed for use with suction pump systems (monthly billing). Clinical use would parallel A6590 for external urine management with wicking material in incontinence patients. This code has minimal documentation in published sources and appears to have limited or no market adoption compared to the A6590 disposable version.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This code is NOT COVERED by Medicare or NY Medicaid. Cash payment required. Product availability in market is limited or unclear.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Coverage Status: NOT COVERED**

**Rationale:**
- Code exists in HCPCS database but lacks Medicare coverage policy
- No LCD L33803 (Urological Supplies) or NCD coverage exists
- Not included in Policy Article A52521
- No formal coverage criteria, documentation requirements, or billing guidelines established
- Limited or no market adoption of reusable external wicking catheters *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Cash Payment Information:**
- No established pricing due to limited market availability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Would require cash payment if product were available
- No claim submission requirements since non-covered

**Clinical Indications (if coverage were available):**
- Clinical use would parallel A6590 disposable version *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Urinary incontinence management requiring non-invasive approach
- Alternative to indwelling catheterization
- Skin integrity preservation in incontinent patients

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Coverage Status: NOT COVERED / NOT ON FEE SCHEDULE**

**Current Status:**
- Code established by CMS effective April 1, 2023
- Not listed in NY Medicaid DME Fee Schedule (effective 7/1/2016)
- Not listed in Medical Supply Procedure Codes manual (effective 10/1/2025)
- NY Medicaid has not adopted this code

**Potential Path to Coverage:**
- Contact NY Medicaid Bureau of Medical Review: (800) 342-3005 *(Under Review)*
- May require prior approval submission as non-covered code with documentation *(Under Review)*
- Documentation needs: permanent incontinence, failed alternatives, medical necessity for reusable vs disposable system *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**⚠️ Since this code is not covered and products have limited market availability, prescribing may not be practical.**

**Required Elements (if product available for cash purchase):**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for urinary incontinence
- [ ] Medical necessity statement *(Under Review)*
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Justification for reusable vs disposable system *(Under Review)*
- [ ] Quantity: 1 unit per month

## Common Denial Reasons

**All Claims Will Deny:**
1. **"Code not covered under Medicare/Medicaid benefit"** - Expected for all claims. No LCD or NCD exists. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No fee schedule amount established"** (Medicaid) - NY Medicaid has not adopted this code. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Product not available"** - Limited or no market adoption may make product difficult to source. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Fix:** Do not submit claims. Consider alternative covered products.

## Tips for Patient Counseling

**Setting Expectations:**
- This code has limited or no market adoption - product may not be available *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- NOT covered by Medicare or Medicaid
- Pricing unknown due to limited availability
- Consider A6590 (disposable) as alternative if cash pay is acceptable

**Alternative Covered Options:**
- Traditional external catheters (male): A4326, A4349 (covered for males) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Urinary collection devices: A4335-A4358 *(Under Review)*
- A6590 disposable external wicking catheter (cash pay but more readily available) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Incontinence supplies through pharmacy benefit *(Under Review)*

**Why Disposable (A6590) May Be Preferable:**
- More widely available in market *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Established manufacturer (PureWick) with support *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Hygiene advantages of single-use products *(Under Review)*
- Clear pricing structure ($195-210/month) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
