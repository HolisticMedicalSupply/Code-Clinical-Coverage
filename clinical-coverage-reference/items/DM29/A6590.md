# A6590 - Disposable External Wicking Catheter (Monthly Supply)

## Clinical Overview

A6590 represents a monthly supply (typically 30 catheters) of disposable external urinary catheters with wicking material designed for use with external suction pump systems *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. The most common brand is PureWick Female External Catheter, though male versions also exist *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. These devices provide non-invasive urine management as an alternative to indwelling catheters, reducing the risk of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) while maintaining skin integrity.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This code is NOT COVERED by Medicare or NY Medicaid. Cash payment required.**
