# E2213 - Insert for Pneumatic Tire (Removable)

## Clinical Overview

E2213 represents a removable flat-free insert for pneumatic propulsion tires on manual wheelchairs. This insert fills the pneumatic tire cavity to prevent punctures while maintaining some of the cushioning benefits of pneumatic tires. The insert is designed for active wheelchair users or patients whose environment presents high puncture risks (outdoor terrain with debris, rough surfaces, thorns, construction areas). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Unlike standard inner tubes (E2212) that hold air, tire inserts are solid foam or honeycomb structures that eliminate flat tires while providing moderate shock absorption - more than foam-filled tires but less than fully inflated pneumatic tires. This is a separately payable accessory that must be medically justified over alternative tire options. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** E2213 is for PNEUMATIC TIRE INSERTS ONLY. This code CANNOT be used for foam-filled tires - if patient needs foam-filled tires, use E2216 (Foam Filled Propulsion Tire) instead. Must justify medical necessity for insert vs. foam-filled tire option. Document puncture risk environment and why insert preferred over foam-filled tires. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Pneumatic tire system:** Patient's wheelchair has pneumatic (air-filled) propulsion tires (E2211) that will use insert instead of inner tube *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Puncture risk environment:** Patient's activities/environment create high risk of tire punctures *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Medical necessity:** Insert medically necessary vs. foam-filled tire alternative (E2216) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
4. **Active user:** Patient's activity level justifies flat-free protection *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document puncture risk environment (outdoor terrain, debris, rough surfaces, construction areas)
- Patient's activity level and wheelchair use pattern
- Justification for insert vs. foam-filled tire (E2216) option
- Why insert preferred: maintains pneumatic tire shell, easier to remove/replace than foam-filled
- Standard modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), or UE (used)

**Important Notes:**

- Separately payable - NOT automatically included at initial wheelchair issue
- For PNEUMATIC tire inserts only - CANNOT use with foam-filled tires
- If patient needs foam-filled tires, bill E2216 instead
- Must justify medical necessity over foam-filled tire alternative
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Puncture risk environment documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient has pneumatic tires (E2211) that will use insert
- Active wheelchair user status
- Justification for insert vs. foam-filled tire

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document puncture risk environment (outdoor, rough terrain, debris)
- Patient's activity level and mobility pattern
- Justification for insert vs. foam-filled tire (E2216)
- Why insert medically necessary

**Important Notes:**

- Separately payable accessory requiring justification
- NOT for foam-filled tires - use E2216 if foam-filled needed
- Document why insert preferred over other tire options

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2213 - Wheelchair accessory, insert for pneumatic propulsion tire (removable), any size, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both rear wheels)
- [ ] Insert size (match existing pneumatic propulsion tire size)
- [ ] Document puncture risk environment (outdoor, rough terrain, debris, construction area)
- [ ] Patient's activity level (active user requiring flat-free protection)
- [ ] Justification for insert vs. foam-filled tire (E2216)
- [ ] Confirm patient has PNEUMATIC tires (not foam-filled)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] NU modifier (new) OR RR (rental) OR UE (used)
- [ ] Document puncture risk clearly
- [ ] Justify insert vs. foam-filled tire option
- [ ] Explain why insert medically necessary

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] NU modifier (typically new)
- [ ] Document puncture risk environment
- [ ] Justify insert vs. foam-filled tire

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Code E2213 not applicable - patient has foam-filled tires"** - Wrong code for tire type. Fix: E2213 is ONLY for inserts used WITH PNEUMATIC TIRES. If patient has or needs foam-filled tires, use E2216 (Foam Filled Propulsion Tire) instead. E2213 cannot be used for foam-filled tires per source documentation. Verify patient's tire type before billing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Medical necessity not established - why insert vs. foam-filled tire"** - No justification for insert over alternative. Fix: Must justify WHY insert preferred over foam-filled tire (E2216). Explain: insert allows keeping pneumatic tire shell (easier to replace insert vs. entire foam-filled tire), insert provides better ride quality than foam-filled, or insert allows future return to standard pneumatic system. Document patient preference and clinical rationale. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Puncture risk environment not documented"** - No evidence of puncture risk. Fix: Document specific environment creating puncture risk: outdoor wheelchair use on trails with thorns/debris, construction area access, rough terrain with sharp rocks, or history of frequent punctures with standard inner tubes. Include frequency of previous punctures if applicable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Not medically necessary - standard inner tubes adequate"** - Insufficient justification. Fix: Document why standard inner tubes (E2212) inadequate: repeated punctures interfering with independence, remote locations without repair access, medical appointments requiring reliable mobility, or active outdoor lifestyle. Explain functional impact of repeated flat tires on patient's mobility and independence. *(Under Review)*

5. **"Insert and inner tube billed together"** - Billing both insert and tube. Fix: Tire inserts REPLACE inner tubes - do not bill both E2213 (insert) and E2212 (tube) for same tire. Insert fills tire cavity instead of inner tube. Bill E2213 only when using insert system. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Use **NU modifier** for new insert (most common) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill 2 units (pair) if inserting both rear wheels *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document puncture risk environment clearly** - outdoor use, rough terrain, debris, thorns *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify insert vs. foam-filled tire (E2216)** - explain WHY insert preferred *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include patient activity level and wheelchair use pattern (active outdoor use) *(Under Review)*
- Specify insert size to match pneumatic propulsion tires *(Under Review)*
- Do NOT bill with E2212 (inner tube) - insert replaces tube *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Emphasize flat-free benefit for patient independence and safety *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- NU modifier typically used for inserts *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document puncture risk environment with specific examples *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify insert vs. foam-filled tire option (E2216) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain patient activity level and need for flat-free protection *(Under Review)*
- Specify insert size and quantity *(Under Review)*
- Do NOT use E2213 for foam-filled tires - use E2216 instead *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
