# E2213 - Insert for Pneumatic Tire (Removable)

## Clinical Overview

Removable flat-free insert for pneumatic propulsion tire. Prevents punctures while maintaining pneumatic tire ride quality. For active users or those in environments with puncture risks.

**Flat-Free Solution:** Insert fills pneumatic tire to prevent flats while maintaining some cushioning. Alternative to foam-filled tire (E2216).

**Do Not Use with Foam-Filled:** Cannot bill E2213 for foam-filled tires. Use E2216 for foam-filled tire replacement.

**Separately Payable:** Not automatically includedâ€”must justify medical necessity.

**Unit:** Each (one insert). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both rear wheels.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when medically necessary for puncture protection. Document environment/activities creating puncture risk. Justify insert vs. foam-filled tire option.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when puncture risk documented and insert medically necessary vs. other tire options.

**Documentation Required:**
- Environment with puncture risks (outdoor terrain, debris, rough surfaces)
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern and activity level
- Justification for insert vs. foam-filled tire (E2216)
- Why standard pneumatic tire maintenance inadequate
