# K0045 - Footrest, Complete Assembly, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Complete footrest assembly replacement including all components: upper hanger bracket (K0044), lower extension tube (K0043), and footplate (K0042). For replacement when multiple components damaged or complete assembly replacement more appropriate than individual components.

**Complete Assembly Includes:**
- K0044: Upper hanger bracket
- K0043: Lower extension tube
- K0042: Footplate

**When to Use K0045:**
- Multiple footrest components damaged
- Complete footrest assembly beyond repair
- More cost-effective to replace complete assembly than multiple individual components

**When to Use Individual Components:**
- Single component damaged: use K0042, K0043, or K0044
- Rest of assembly functional

**Replacement Only:** Footrest assembly included at initial wheelchair issue. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one complete footrest). Typically bill as pair (2 units) if both footrests need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when complete footrest assembly needs replacement. Document need for complete assembly vs. individual components (more economical or multiple components damaged). RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Justify complete assembly replacementâ€”document multiple component damage or explain why complete assembly more appropriate than component replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Footrest assembly damage (multiple components damaged, beyond repair)
- Justification for complete assembly vs. individual components:
  - Multiple components damaged (list which ones)
  - Cost comparison showing complete assembly more economical
  - Complete assembly necessary for proper function
- RB modifier (replacement)
- Bill each footrest separately or as pair depending on replacement need
