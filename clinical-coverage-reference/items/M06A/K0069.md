# K0069 - Rear Wheel Assembly, Complete, With Solid Tire, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Complete rear wheel assembly replacement with solid tire for beneficiary-owned manual wheelchair. Includes wheel rim, solid tire, and spokes (or molded construction). For replacement when wheel reaches end of reasonable useful lifetime or damaged.

**Complete Assembly:** Includes all wheel components:
- Wheel rim (E2224)
- Solid tire (E2220)
- Spokes or molded construction
- Hub and bearings

**Solid Tire:** Hard rubber or plastic tire (no air). Appropriate for:
- Indoor use primarily
- Flat-free operation
- Limited terrain (smooth surfaces)
- Minimal maintenance

**Replacement Only:** NOT an upgrade to different wheel type. Must be replacement of existing wheel system when worn or damaged.

**Reasonable Useful Lifetime:** Typically 5 years for wheelchair components. Replacement before 5 years requires damage justification.

**Unit:** Each (one wheel). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both rear wheels if both need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when wheel assembly worn or damaged and wheelchair ownership verified. SWO required before delivery. Justification for replacement vs. repair needed. Must be replacement, not upgrade. RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Prior approval may be required if cost exceeds threshold *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document wheel condition and justification for complete assembly replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of wheelchair ownership
- Wheelchair still meets coverage criteria (medical necessity continues)
- Wheel assembly damage or wear (specify: rim damage, tire wear, spoke failure)
- Justification for replacement vs. repair
- If before 5-year lifetime: specific damage requiring early replacement
- Why complete assembly vs. individual components (E2220 tire, E2224 rim separately)
- SWO (Standard Written Order) before delivery
- RB modifier (replacement)
