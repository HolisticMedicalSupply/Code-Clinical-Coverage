# K0020 - Fixed, Adjustable Height Armrest, Pair

## Clinical Overview

Fixed (non-removable), adjustable height armrests for manual or power wheelchair. Billed as pair. For patients requiring adjustable arm height but non-removable armrests for bilateral upper extremity support.

**Fixed vs. Detachable:** Fixed armrests cannot be removed (compare to K0017 detachable). Used when patient needs armrests for stability and cannot have removable arms.

**Adjustable Height:** Arm height can be adjusted to accommodate patient anatomy (compare to K0015 non-adjustable).

**Medicare Coverage Criteria:**
- Requires different arm height (patient measurements outside standard range) AND
- Spends ≥2 hours/day in wheelchair

**Bundling:** K0020 includes K0019 (arm pads). Included in power tilt/recline systems.

**Unit:** Pair (both armrests billed as 1 unit).

## Coverage

**Medicare LCD:** Covered when patient requires different arm height than standard AND uses wheelchair 2+ hours daily. Document bilateral need, specific height requirements, daily usage, why fixed armrests necessary.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when adjustable height medically necessary. Prior approval may be required for power wheelchairs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document bilateral need and why fixed vs. detachable armrests.

**Documentation Required:**
- Patient measurements (arm length, torso height, shoulder-to-elbow dimensions)
- Why standard non-adjustable armrests inadequate
- Wheelchair use: 2+ hours/day
- Bilateral upper extremity support needs
- Why fixed (non-removable) armrests necessary vs. detachable (K0017)
- Functional needs (stability, positioning, pressure relief, transfers)
- Billed as pair (unit = 1 pair, not 2 each)
