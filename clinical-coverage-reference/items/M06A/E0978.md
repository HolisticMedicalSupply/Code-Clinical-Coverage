# E0978 - Positioning/Safety Belt

## Clinical Overview

Positioning/safety belt (pelvic strap) for weak upper body muscles, instability, spasticity, fall risk, or seating alignment.

**Medicare:** Covered if weak upper body, instability, or spasticity.

**NY Medicaid:** Standard 2-point belt included. Multi-point belts separately billable.

**PT/OT Assessment Recommended.**

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. Document weak upper body muscles, instability, spasticity, or fall risk. PT/OT assessment recommended documenting postural support needs. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

**NY Medicaid Specific:** Standard 2-point belt included in wheelchair. Multi-point belts (3-point, 4-point, 5-point) separately billable with additional justification.

## Common Denials

1. **"No upper body weakness/instability documented"** - Must document weak upper body, instability, or spasticity per Medicare LCD.
2. **"Standard 2-point adequate"** (Medicaid, if billing multi-point) - Must justify why multi-point belt necessary vs. standard 2-point.
