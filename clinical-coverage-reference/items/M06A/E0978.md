# E0978 - Positioning/Safety Belt

## Clinical Overview

Positioning/safety belt (pelvic strap) for weak upper body muscles, instability, spasticity, fall risk, or seating alignment. For patients with upper body weakness, trunk instability, or spasticity requiring postural support in wheelchair.

**Medicare Coverage Criteria:** Covered if weak upper body, instability, or spasticity documented.

**NY Medicaid:** Standard 2-point belt included in wheelchair base. Multi-point belts (3-point, 4-point, 5-point) separately billable with additional justification.

**PT/OT Assessment Recommended** for documenting postural support needs.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. Document weak upper body muscles, instability, or spasticity per Medicare LCD criteria. PT/OT assessment recommended documenting postural support needs and appropriate belt configuration. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Standard 2-point belt included in wheelchair at initial issue. Multi-point belts (3-point, 4-point, 5-point) separately billable with additional justification showing why standard 2-point inadequate. PT/OT assessment. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No upper body weakness/instability documented"** - Must document weak upper body muscles, instability, or spasticity per Medicare LCD coverage criteria. Include PT/OT assessment showing trunk control deficits.

2. **"Standard 2-point adequate"** (Medicaid, if billing multi-point) - When billing multi-point belt configuration, must justify why standard 2-point belt inadequate. Document severity of trunk instability, spasticity, or fall risk requiring enhanced restraint system.
