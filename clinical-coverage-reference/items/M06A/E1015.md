# E1015 - Shock Absorber, Manual Wheelchair

## Clinical Overview

Shock absorber for manual wheelchair used over rough terrain regularly. For conditions requiring vibration dampening: spinal conditions, chronic pain, skin breakdown exacerbated by jarring, osteoporosis.

**Covered When Medically Necessary:** Must demonstrate medical necessity to minimize jarring affecting medical condition.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. Document: (1) Terrain/environment (rough surfaces, uneven ground, outdoor use), (2) Medical condition requiring shock absorption (osteoporosis, spinal conditions, chronic pain, pressure ulcers), (3) How jarring affects medical condition. NY Medicaid PA may be required.

## Common Denials

1. **"No medical necessity"** - Must document medical condition affected by jarring (osteoporosis, spinal pain, pressure ulcers).
2. **"No terrain description"** - Describe specific terrain/environment requiring shock absorption (rough surfaces, outdoor use, uneven ground).
3. **"Comfort preference"** - Must be medical necessity, not comfort preference.
