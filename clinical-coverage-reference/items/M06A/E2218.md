# E2218 - Foam Propulsion Tire (Solid Urethane)

## Clinical Overview

E2218 represents replacement solid urethane foam propulsion tires for the rear wheels of manual wheelchairs. These are self-skinning urethane tires with solid foam construction and an integral outer surface, eliminating the need for a separate tire shell, inner tube, or foam filling. They provide the ultimate in durability and maintenance-free operation, particularly suited for indoor wheelchair use on smooth surfaces. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Solid urethane tires offer the firmest ride of all tire options: firmer than pneumatic (air-filled) and foam-filled tires. The trade-off is minimal cushioning for maximum durability and zero maintenance. These tires never go flat, never require inflation, and are highly resistant to wear. They are ideal for institutional settings, nursing homes, or patients who use wheelchairs primarily indoors on smooth floors. Solid urethane tires are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue; E2218 is only separately billable when replacing worn tires. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Solid urethane foam propulsion tires are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue. E2218 is only separately billable when replacing worn solid urethane tires on existing wheelchair. Document tire wear and justify solid urethane tire type for patient's use pattern (primarily indoor use, need for durability). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Tire wear/damage:** Solid urethane tires worn, damaged, or no longer functional *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Appropriate tire type:** Solid urethane tires appropriate for patient's usage pattern (primarily indoor use, smooth surfaces, durability needs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document tire wear or damage (tread wear, urethane degradation, hardening, cracking)
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (primarily indoor use on smooth surfaces)
- Justification for solid urethane tire type (durability, low-maintenance, indoor use)
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both rear wheels)

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue (included in base code)
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- Solid urethane appropriate for indoor/institutional use on smooth surfaces
- No inner tubes or foam filling required
- Solid urethane tires typically last longer than pneumatic or foam-filled due to construction
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Tire wear/damage requiring replacement
- Appropriate for patient's wheelchair use pattern (indoor use)

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document tire wear/damage (urethane degradation, tread wear, hardening)
- Patient's usage pattern (primarily indoor use)
- RB modifier for replacement billing
- Quantity (typically 2 for pair)

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only - not billable at initial wheelchair issue
- Document tire condition and need for replacement
- Solid urethane provides maximum durability for indoor use

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2218 - Wheelchair accessory, foam propulsion tire, any size, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both rear wheels)
- [ ] Tire size (e.g., 24", 25", 26" - match existing wheelchair)
- [ ] Evidence of tire wear/damage (urethane degradation, tread wear, hardening, cracking)
- [ ] Patient's wheelchair use pattern (primarily indoor use, smooth surfaces)
- [ ] Justification for solid urethane tire type (durability, low-maintenance, institutional use)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair
- [ ] Justify solid urethane tire type (indoor use, durability needs)
- [ ] Document tire wear/damage clearly

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Document tire wear/damage clearly
- [ ] Specify tire size and quantity

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue. Fix: E2218 is REPLACEMENT ONLY. Only bill when replacing worn solid urethane tires on existing wheelchair, not at initial wheelchair issue. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient documentation of tire wear"** - No evidence of urethane tire deterioration. Fix: Document specific tire wear: tread completely worn smooth, urethane hardening or cracking, surface degradation, loss of structural integrity, or age-related deterioration. Solid urethane tires typically last longer than other tire types - if replacing earlier, document premature wear reason (heavy use, manufacturing defect). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Solid urethane not appropriate for patient's use"** - Patient uses wheelchair outdoors extensively. Fix: Solid urethane tires are best suited for INDOOR use on smooth surfaces. If patient primarily uses wheelchair outdoors on uneven terrain, pneumatic (E2211) or foam-filled (E2216) tires may be more appropriate for shock absorption. Justify solid urethane choice based on patient's predominantly indoor use pattern, institutional setting, or specific need for maximum durability. *(Under Review)*

4. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2218 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Confusion with foam-filled tires"** - Mixing up E2218 with E2216. Fix: E2218 is for SOLID URETHANE (self-skinning foam) tires, while E2216 is for FOAM-FILLED (urethane foam filling inside regular tire shell) tires. They are different constructions. E2218 is firmer and more durable. Specify tire type clearly. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Always use **RB modifier** to indicate replacement part *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill 2 units (pair) if replacing both rear wheels *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document tire wear clearly: tread worn smooth, urethane hardening, cracking, degradation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify solid urethane tire type** - explain indoor use, durability needs, low-maintenance requirements *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include patient's wheelchair use pattern: primarily indoor on smooth surfaces *(Under Review)*
- Solid urethane appropriate for institutional settings, nursing homes, smooth indoor floors *(Under Review)*
- Specify tire size to match wheelchair *(Under Review)*
- Ensure replacement is within wheelchair's 5-year reasonable useful lifetime *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document tire wear/damage with specific evidence of urethane deterioration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify solid urethane tire choice: indoor use, durability, institutional setting *(Under Review)*
- Specify tire size and quantity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain low-maintenance benefit for patient's care setting *(Under Review)*
