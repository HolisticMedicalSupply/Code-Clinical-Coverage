# E2218 - Foam Propulsion Tire (Solid Urethane)

## Clinical Overview

Solid urethane foam propulsion tire for rear wheels of manual wheelchair. Self-skinning urethane construction (no separate tire shell). Low-maintenance, durable option primarily for indoor use.

**Self-Skinning Urethane:** Solid foam construction with integral outer surface (no separate tire and tube). Provides firm ride with durability.

**Indoor Use:** Best suited for smooth indoor surfaces. Less cushioning than pneumatic or foam-filled tires but very durable.

**Replacement Only:** Tires included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both rear wheels.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when tires worn or damaged. Solid urethane appropriate for durability and low-maintenance needs, primarily indoor use.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document tire wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Tire wear or damage requiring replacement
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (primarily indoor use)
- RB modifier (replacement)
