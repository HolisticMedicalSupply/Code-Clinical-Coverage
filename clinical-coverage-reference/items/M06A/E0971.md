## Clinical Overview

Anti-tipping device for manual wheelchairs to prevent backward tipping. For patients at risk due to inclines/ramps, upper body instability, or pediatric users.

**NOT Separately Billable with Power Wheelchairs:** Included in power wheelchair base. Only separately billable for manual wheelchairs.

**Typically Pair:** Usually billed as pair (2 devices). Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Coverage

**CRITICAL:** NOT separately billable with power wheelchairs (included). Only bill separately for manual wheelchairs.

## Common Denials
