# E0971 - Anti-Tipping Device

## Clinical Overview

Anti-tipping device for manual wheelchairs to prevent backward tipping. For patients at risk due to inclines/ramps, upper body instability, or pediatric wheelchair users.

**NOT Separately Billable with Power Wheelchairs:** Included in power wheelchair base. Only separately billable for MANUAL wheelchairs.

**Typically Pair:** Usually billed as pair (2 devices). Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. **CRITICAL:** NOT separately billable with power wheelchairs (included in base). Only bill separately for MANUAL wheelchairs.

Document:
- Safety need: backward tipping risk
- Environmental factors: inclines, ramps in home/community
- Upper body instability OR pediatric use justifying anti-tipping device

Typically billed as pair (2 devices). Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. **CRITICAL:** Separately billable for MANUAL wheelchairs only. NOT separately billable with power wheelchairs (included).

Document:
- Safety need: risk of backward tipping
- Environmental factors: ramps, inclines requiring anti-tipping protection
- Upper body instability or pediatric use

Typically billed as pair (2 devices). Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed with power wheelchair"** - NOT separately billable with power wheelchairs (included in power wheelchair base). Only bill separately when provided with MANUAL wheelchairs.

2. **"No safety need documented"** - Must document backward tipping risk. Include specific safety concerns: upper body instability, pediatric use, risk on inclines/ramps.

3. **"No environmental factors documented"** - Document specific inclines/ramps in home or community environment requiring anti-tipping device for safe wheelchair use.

4. **"Exceeded frequency limit"** - Limited to 2 in 5 years (typically billed as pair, so this is usually one pair per 5 years). Document medical necessity if requesting earlier replacement.
