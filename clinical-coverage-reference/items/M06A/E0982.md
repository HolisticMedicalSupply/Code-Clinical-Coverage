# E0982 - Back Upholstery, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Back upholstery replacement for worn back upholstery, postural support compromise, or infection control needs. **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code - NOT billable at initial wheelchair issue.

**Same Requirements as E0981:** REPLACEMENT ONLY. Medical necessity (not cosmetic). Evidence of deterioration affecting postural support or creating medical concern required. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. **RB modifier** (replacement of part). Evidence of deterioration affecting postural support or medical necessity (infection control, pressure ulcer risk from material breakdown). NOT for cosmetic replacement. Same requirements as E0981 seat upholstery. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Replacement only. Evidence of wear/tear compromising postural support required. Medical necessity (functional deterioration affecting back support, infection control, skin breakdown risk), not cosmetic preference. Same criteria as E0981. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Common Denial Reasons

Same denial reasons as E0981:

1. **"Billed at initial issue"** - REPLACEMENT ONLY code. Cannot be billed when new wheelchair first dispensed. Only for replacing worn back upholstery on beneficiary-owned wheelchair.

2. **"Cosmetic replacement"** - Must be medical necessity. Document functional deterioration (tears compromising postural/back support, material breakdown affecting trunk alignment, soiling creating infection control concern), not cosmetic appearance preference.

3. **"No deterioration evidence"** - Document wear/tear with photo documentation or detailed written description showing compromise to postural support function or medical risk. Describe specific areas of back upholstery deterioration affecting function.
