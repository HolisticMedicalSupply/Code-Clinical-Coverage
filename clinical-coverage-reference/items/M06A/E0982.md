# E0982 - Back Upholstery, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

The E0982 back upholstery replacement code covers replacement of the wheelchair back fabric/upholstery when the original back upholstery has deteriorated to the point of postural support compromise or medical concern. This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code that cannot be billed when a wheelchair is initially dispensed - it is exclusively for replacing worn, torn, or damaged back upholstery on a beneficiary-owned wheelchair after the initial delivery.

Back upholstery replacement is medically necessary when wear/tear affects postural support function (tears or material breakdown compromising back integrity and trunk support, sagging fabric reducing postural control), infection control needs (soiling, contamination, or material degradation creating infection risk that cannot be adequately cleaned), or skin breakdown risk from deteriorated upholstery (rough surfaces, exposed hardware, or material degradation threatening skin integrity at back contact points). Back upholstery provides critical trunk support and postural alignment - deterioration compromises the wheelchair's ability to maintain proper trunk position and may affect sitting tolerance, pressure distribution, and functional abilities. Common scenarios include daily wheelchair use causing fabric tears or sagging that compromise trunk support, incontinence or wound drainage causing persistent soiling at back contact areas, material wear exposing rough edges or hardware creating pressure points at thoracic or lumbar spine contact areas. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION - MEDICAL NECESSITY, NOT COSMETIC:** Same as E0981, this is the single most important criterion. Back upholstery replacement must be for medical necessity (functional deterioration affecting postural support/trunk alignment, infection control concerns, or skin breakdown risk), NOT for cosmetic preference or aesthetic appearance concerns. Faded color, minor stains that can be cleaned, or desire for updated appearance are NOT covered reasons - must document postural support compromise or medical risk. *(verified from source - same as E0981, medical necessity not cosmetic)*

**EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION REQUIRED:** Must document wear/tear with photo documentation or detailed written description showing postural support compromise or medical risk. *(verified from source - same as E0981)* **RB modifier required.** *(verified from source)* Frequency limit: 1 in 12 months. *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. **RB modifier** (replacement of part). Evidence of deterioration affecting postural support or medical necessity (infection control, pressure ulcer risk from material breakdown). NOT for cosmetic replacement. Same requirements as E0981 seat upholstery. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Replacement only. Evidence of wear/tear compromising postural support required. Medical necessity (functional deterioration affecting back support, infection control, skin breakdown risk), not cosmetic preference. Same criteria as E0981. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements (Same as E0981):**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - wheelchair dependence (Z99.3), pressure ulcer (L89.x)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting postural support compromise OR medical concern
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Document medical necessity, NOT cosmetic**
- [ ] Evidence of deterioration: photo documentation OR detailed written description
- [ ] Specific areas: tears, sagging, material breakdown, soiling, hardware exposure
- [ ] How deterioration affects postural support OR creates medical risk
- [ ] **RB modifier** required
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

- [ ] **Medical necessity:** Tears/sagging affecting trunk support, soiling creating infection risk, OR material breakdown threatening skin integrity
- [ ] **NOT cosmetic:** Cannot replace for faded color, minor stains, or aesthetic preference
- [ ] RB modifier required
- [ ] Verify frequency: 1 in 12 months

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] **REPLACEMENT ONLY**
- [ ] Evidence of deterioration documented
- [ ] **Medical necessity:** Postural support OR medical concern, not cosmetic
- [ ] Verify frequency: 1 in 12 months

## Common Denial Reasons

Same denial patterns as E0981, adapted for back upholstery:

1. **"Cosmetic replacement - not medically necessary"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL. Fix: **Document medical necessity - postural support compromise OR medical concern.** (1) **Postural support:** Tears/sagging compromising back support and trunk alignment: "Back upholstery has significant sagging at thoracic support area reducing trunk support; patient unable to maintain erect posture due to inadequate back support; replacement required for functional postural control." (2) **Infection control:** Persistent soiling at back contact areas: "Patient with incontinence; back upholstery persistently soiled at sacral/lumbar contact areas; material absorbed fluids creating infection risk." (3) **Skin breakdown risk:** Material degradation exposing surfaces: "Upholstery worn through at thoracic spine contact points exposing underlying surface; pressure point risk for skin breakdown." Photos recommended. Cosmetic concerns NOT covered. *(verified from source)*

2. **"Billed at initial wheelchair issue"** - E0982 billed at new wheelchair delivery. REPLACEMENT ONLY code. Fix: **Only bill when replacing back upholstery on beneficiary-owned wheelchair already in use.** Verify wheelchair previously delivered. At initial setup, back upholstery included in wheelchair base - cannot unbundle. Document: "Patient owns manual wheelchair (delivered [date]); back upholstery now deteriorated requiring replacement." *(verified from source)*

3. **"No evidence of deterioration documented"** - No documented evidence showing postural support compromise or medical risk. Fix: **Provide photo documentation OR detailed written description.** Document: location (upper back, lumbar support, full back), size of damage, nature of deterioration (tears, sagging, material thinning, soiling, seam separation), how deterioration affects postural support or creates medical concern. Example: "Back upholstery has significant sagging at mid-thoracic level (6-inch area) reducing trunk support; patient's trunk flexes forward due to inadequate back support; photos attached." *(verified from source)*

4. **"Postural support compromise not documented"** - For back upholstery, emphasis on HOW deterioration affects trunk support/alignment. Fix: **Clearly document impact on postural support function.** Describe: "Sagging back fabric reduces trunk support causing forward trunk flexion and compromised sitting posture" or "Tears at lumbar support area eliminate lower back support critical for pelvic stabilization." Connect back deterioration to specific postural support compromise. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Frequency limit exceeded"** - Requesting replacement before 12 months. Fix: Verify timing >12 months since last E0982. If early replacement needed, document: "Back upholstery replaced [date]; premature failure due to [cause]; replacement medically necessary for [postural support / infection control / skin breakdown prevention]." *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Medical necessity, NOT cosmetic:** Single most critical factor - same as E0981 *(verified from source)*
- **Photo documentation recommended:** Visual evidence of back deterioration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document postural support impact:** Explain how deterioration affects trunk support/alignment - key distinction for back upholstery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **RB modifier required:** Replacement of DME part *(verified from source)*
- **Replacement only:** Cannot bill at initial delivery *(verified from source)*
- **Verify frequency:** 1 in 12 months *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same as Medicare:** Medical vs cosmetic distinction critical *(Under Review)*
- **Evidence required:** Photos or detailed description *(verified from source)*
- **Postural support emphasis:** Document impact on trunk support *(Under Review)*
- **Fiscal order required:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*

**Medical Necessity Categories:**
- **Postural support deterioration:** Tears/sagging compromising trunk support and alignment *(verified from source)*
- **Infection control:** Persistent soiling at back contact areas *(verified from source)*
- **Skin breakdown risk:** Material degradation at thoracic/lumbar spine contact points *(verified from source)*

**NOT Covered (Cosmetic):**
- Faded/discolored fabric *(Under Review)*
- Minor stains that can be cleaned *(Under Review)*
- Aesthetic preference *(Under Review)*
