# E0982 - Back Upholstery, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Back upholstery replacement for worn back upholstery or postural support compromise.

**Same Requirements as E0981:** REPLACEMENT ONLY. Medical necessity, not cosmetic. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. RB modifier. Evidence of deterioration affecting postural support or medical necessity (infection control, pressure ulcer risk). NOT cosmetic. Same requirements as E0981 seat upholstery. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Common Denials

Same as E0981:
1. **"Billed at initial issue"** - Replacement only.
2. **"Cosmetic"** - Must be medical necessity.
3. **"No deterioration evidence"** - Document functional compromise or medical risk.
