# E1020 - Residual Limb Support System

## Clinical Overview

The E1020 residual limb support system is a wheelchair accessory that provides positioning and support for the residual limb (stump) of lower extremity amputees. This system consists of a support platform with adjustable positioning components and cushioning that accommodates the residual limb, preventing it from dangling unsupported and maintaining proper anatomical alignment during wheelchair use.

Residual limb support systems are medically necessary for wheelchair users with lower extremity amputations at any level (transtibial/below knee, transfemoral/above knee, knee disarticulation, or hip disarticulation) who require residual limb positioning and support for preventing hip/knee contractures (unsupported residual limb promotes flexion contractures reducing future prosthetic potential), maintaining proper weight distribution (supporting residual limb prevents asymmetric sitting causing pressure ulcers on intact side), protecting residual limb from trauma (prevents residual limb from hitting wheelchair components or getting caught in wheels), and providing comfort for residual limb during extended wheelchair use. Without residual limb support, amputees experience contracture development limiting rehabilitation potential, increased pressure ulcer risk from asymmetric weight bearing, residual limb pain from unsupported positioning, and risk of trauma to unprotected residual limb. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL BUNDLING - INCLUDES SWINGAWAY MOUNTING:** E1020 residual limb support system INCLUDES swingaway mounting hardware in the base code. DO NOT bill E1028 (swingaway/removable mounting hardware) separately with E1020 - this is unbundling and will result in denial. Swingaway capability is inherent to residual limb support systems for transfer access. *(verified from source - includes swingaway, do not bill E1028)* **NY Medicaid PA may be required.** *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. Document: (1) Amputation level with ICD-10 code - transtibial/below knee (Z89.5x), transfemoral/above knee (Z89.6x), hip disarticulation, traumatic amputation (S78.x, S88.x), amputation complications (T87.x), (2) Need for residual limb support system - positioning requirements, contracture prevention, proper weight distribution, residual limb protection, (3) Functional need for positioning during wheelchair use. *(verified from source)*

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Same documentation as Medicare - amputation level, positioning need, functional requirements. **Prior approval may be required** - verify PA requirements before ordering. *(verified from source)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - amputation with level: Z89.5x (below knee), Z89.6x (above knee), S78.x (traumatic hip/thigh), S88.x (traumatic lower leg), T87.x (complications)
- [ ] Amputation level documented - transtibial, transfemoral, knee disarticulation, hip disarticulation
- [ ] Medical necessity for residual limb support - positioning, contracture prevention, weight distribution
- [ ] Functional need during wheelchair use
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Do NOT bill E1028 separately** - swingaway mounting included in E1020
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] Amputation level and ICD-10 code
- [ ] Residual limb positioning needs documented
- [ ] Functional necessity explained
- [ ] **Swingaway included** - do NOT add E1028

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] **Verify if PA required** before ordering
- [ ] Same documentation as Medicare
- [ ] **Swingaway included** - do NOT add E1028

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No amputation documented or amputation level unspecified"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL. Prescription requests residual limb support without documenting lower extremity amputation or specifying amputation level. Fix: **Document specific LE amputation with level.** Include: amputation level (transtibial/below knee, transfemoral/above knee, knee disarticulation, hip disarticulation), ICD-10 code (Z89.5x for below knee, Z89.6x for above knee), side affected (right, left, bilateral). Example: "Patient has right transfemoral amputation (Z89.611 above knee amputation); residual limb requires support system for positioning during wheelchair use to prevent hip contracture and maintain proper weight distribution." Amputation level determines support system configuration - must be specified. *(verified from source - must document amputation level)*

2. **"No positioning need/functional necessity documented"** - Amputation documented but prescription doesn't explain WHY residual limb support system is medically necessary. Fix: **Document specific positioning needs and functional necessity.** Include: contracture prevention ("residual limb support maintains hip/knee extension preventing flexion contractures that would compromise future prosthetic fitting"), proper weight distribution ("supports residual limb preventing asymmetric sitting that creates pressure ulcer risk on intact side"), residual limb protection ("prevents trauma from wheelchair components and wheel contact"), comfort during extended use. Example: "Patient with left transtibial amputation requires residual limb support to prevent knee flexion contracture, maintain symmetric weight distribution in wheelchair, and protect residual limb from trauma during transfers and wheelchair mobility." Functional need demonstrates medical necessity. *(verified from source - must document functional need)*

3. **"Billed E1028 separately - unbundling error"** - CRITICAL BILLING ERROR. E1028 (swingaway/removable mounting hardware) billed separately with E1020. This is unbundling - swingaway mounting is included in E1020 residual limb support system and cannot be billed separately. Fix: **Do NOT bill E1028 with E1020.** E1020 includes swingaway mounting capability as standard feature - residual limb supports inherently need swingaway function for transfer access. Only bill E1020 for residual limb support with included swingaway mounting. Billing both E1020 and E1028 together will result in denial for unbundling. This is one of most common E1020 billing errors. *(verified from source - includes swingaway mounting, do not bill E1028 separately)*

4. **"No prior approval" (NY Medicaid, if required)** - NY Medicaid PA may be required for residual limb support systems but not obtained before ordering. Fix: **Verify NY Medicaid PA requirements before ordering E1020.** If PA required, submit prior approval request with documentation (amputation level, positioning needs, functional necessity) before dispensing. Include all required clinical information in PA submission. Do not dispense without PA approval if required. *(verified from source - PA may be required)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Amputation level required:** Specify transtibial, transfemoral, knee disarticulation, hip disarticulation *(verified from source)*
- **ICD-10 codes:** Z89.5x (below knee), Z89.6x (above knee), S78/S88 (traumatic), T87 (complications) *(verified from source)*
- **Document positioning needs:** Contracture prevention, weight distribution, protection *(verified from source)*
- **Functional necessity:** Explain need during wheelchair use *(verified from source)*
- **NEVER bill E1028 with E1020:** Swingaway included - critical billing rule *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **PA may be required:** Verify before ordering *(verified from source)*
- **Same documentation as Medicare:** Amputation level, positioning needs, functional necessity *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order format:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*
- **Swingaway included:** Same E1028 bundling rule as Medicare *(verified from source)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios:**
- Transtibial amputation requiring residual limb positioning to prevent knee contracture *(verified from source)*
- Transfemoral amputation requiring support for weight distribution and hip contracture prevention *(verified from source)*
- Hip disarticulation requiring residual limb accommodation *(verified from source)*
- Bilateral amputations requiring residual limb support systems *(Under Review)*

**Bundling Critical:**
- **E1020 includes swingaway:** Do NOT bill E1028 separately *(verified from source - most critical requirement)*
- **Why bundled:** Residual limb supports inherently need swingaway for transfer access *(Under Review)*
