# E1020 - Residual Limb Support System

## Clinical Overview

Residual limb support system for LE amputation. For transtibial, transfemoral, or hip disarticulation requiring residual limb positioning/support, preventing contractures, and proper weight distribution.

**Includes Swingaway Mounting:** DO NOT bill E1028 separately - swingaway mounting included in E1020.

**NY Medicaid PA May Be Required.**

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. Document: (1) Amputation level (below knee Z89.5x, above knee Z89.6x, hip disarticulation), (2) Need for residual limb support system (positioning, contracture prevention, weight distribution), (3) Functional need for positioning. NY Medicaid PA may be required.

**CRITICAL:** Includes swingaway mounting hardware - do NOT bill E1028 separately with E1020.

## Common Denials

1. **"No amputation documented"** - Must document LE amputation with level (transtibial, transfemoral, hip disarticulation).
2. **"No positioning need documented"** - Document specific need: residual limb positioning, contracture prevention, weight distribution, functional positioning requirements.
3. **"Billed E1028 separately"** - Do NOT bill E1028 with E1020 - swingaway mounting included.
