# K0038 - Leg Strap

## Clinical Overview

Leg strap for wheelchair footrest. Prevents foot/leg from slipping off footrest due to muscle weakness, spasticity, or involuntary movements. Basic strap design.

**Not Separately Billable:** Included in footrest codes—not billed separately. Part of footrest assembly when medically necessary.

**Function:** Secures lower extremity to footrest to prevent foot from sliding off due to:
- Lower extremity muscle weakness
- Spasticity causing leg/foot movement
- Involuntary movements
- Poor foot positioning control

**vs. K0039 (H-Style):** K0038 is standard leg strap. K0039 is H-style strap for stronger spasticity requiring more secure stabilization.

**Bundling:** K0038 bundled with K0039.

**Unit:** Each (one strap). May be billed for single leg or both depending on need.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Included in footrest codes—not separately billable. Document lower extremity instability, spasticity, or positioning needs requiring leg strap.

**NY Medicaid:** Included in footrest codes. Document lower extremity positioning needs and safety concerns without leg strap.

**Documentation Required:**
- Lower extremity diagnosis (weakness, spasticity, involuntary movements)
- Functional assessment: foot/leg slipping off footrest without strap
- Safety concerns (foot injury risk, positioning problems)
- Medical necessity for leg stabilization
- Note: Typically documented as included component of footrest system rather than billed separately
