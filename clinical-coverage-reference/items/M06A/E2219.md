# E2219 - Foam Caster Tire (Solid Urethane)

## Clinical Overview

Solid urethane foam caster tire for front wheels of manual wheelchair. Self-skinning urethane construction (no separate tire shell). Low-maintenance, durable option primarily for indoor use.

**Self-Skinning Urethane:** Solid foam construction with integral outer surface. Provides firm ride with excellent durability.

**Caster Location:** Front wheels (typically smaller than rear propulsion wheels).

**Indoor Use:** Best suited for smooth indoor surfaces. Less cushioning than pneumatic or foam-filled casters but very durable and low-maintenance.

**Replacement Only:** Caster tires included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one caster tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when caster tires worn or damaged. Solid urethane appropriate for durability and low-maintenance needs, primarily indoor use.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document tire wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Caster tire wear or damage
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (primarily indoor use)
- RB modifier (replacement)
