# E2219 - Foam Caster Tire (Solid Urethane)

## Clinical Overview

E2219 represents replacement solid urethane foam caster tires for the front wheels of manual wheelchairs. These are self-skinning urethane tires with solid foam construction and an integral outer surface, similar to E2218 but for caster (front) wheels instead of propulsion (rear) wheels. They provide the ultimate in durability and maintenance-free operation for front casters, particularly suited for indoor wheelchair use on smooth surfaces. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Solid urethane caster tires offer the firmest ride of all caster tire options: firmer than pneumatic (air-filled) and foam-filled casters. The trade-off is minimal cushioning for maximum durability and zero maintenance. These casters never go flat, never require inflation, and are highly resistant to wear. They are ideal for institutional settings, nursing homes, or patients who use wheelchairs primarily indoors on smooth floors. Solid urethane casters are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue; E2219 is only separately billable when replacing worn casters. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Solid urethane foam caster tires are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue. E2219 is only separately billable when replacing worn solid urethane casters on existing wheelchair. Document caster tire wear and justify solid urethane tire type for patient's use pattern (primarily indoor use, need for durability). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Caster tire wear/damage:** Solid urethane caster tires worn, damaged, or no longer functional *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Appropriate tire type:** Solid urethane casters appropriate for patient's usage pattern (primarily indoor use, smooth surfaces, durability needs) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document caster tire wear or damage (tread wear, urethane degradation, hardening, cracking)
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (primarily indoor use on smooth surfaces)
- Justification for solid urethane caster tire type (durability, low-maintenance, indoor use)
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both front casters)

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue (included in base code)
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- Solid urethane appropriate for indoor/institutional use on smooth surfaces
- No inner tubes or foam filling required
- Solid urethane casters typically last longer than pneumatic or foam-filled due to construction
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Caster tire wear/damage requiring replacement
- Appropriate for patient's wheelchair use pattern (indoor use)

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document caster tire wear/damage (urethane degradation, tread wear, hardening)
- Patient's usage pattern (primarily indoor use)
- RB modifier for replacement billing
- Quantity (typically 2 for pair)

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only - not billable at initial wheelchair issue
- Document caster tire condition and need for replacement
- Solid urethane provides maximum durability for indoor use

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2219 - Wheelchair accessory, foam caster tire, any size, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both front casters)
- [ ] Caster tire size (e.g., 6", 7", 8" - match existing wheelchair)
- [ ] Evidence of caster tire wear/damage (urethane degradation, tread wear, hardening, cracking)
- [ ] Patient's wheelchair use pattern (primarily indoor use, smooth surfaces)
- [ ] Justification for solid urethane caster tire type (durability, low-maintenance, institutional use)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair
- [ ] Justify solid urethane caster tire type (indoor use, durability needs)
- [ ] Document caster tire wear/damage clearly

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Document caster tire wear/damage clearly
- [ ] Specify caster tire size and quantity

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue. Fix: E2219 is REPLACEMENT ONLY. Only bill when replacing worn solid urethane casters on existing wheelchair, not at initial wheelchair issue. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient documentation of caster tire wear"** - No evidence of urethane caster tire deterioration. Fix: Document specific caster tire wear: tread completely worn smooth, urethane hardening or cracking, surface degradation, loss of structural integrity, or age-related deterioration. Casters wear differently than propulsion tires due to swiveling motion. Solid urethane casters typically last longer than other caster types - if replacing earlier, document premature wear reason (heavy use, manufacturing defect). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Solid urethane not appropriate for patient's use"** - Patient uses wheelchair outdoors extensively on rough terrain. Fix: Solid urethane casters are best suited for INDOOR use on smooth surfaces. If patient primarily uses wheelchair outdoors on uneven terrain, pneumatic (E2214) or foam-filled (E2217) casters may be more appropriate for shock absorption. Justify solid urethane choice based on patient's predominantly indoor use pattern, institutional setting, or specific need for maximum durability. *(Under Review)*

4. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2219 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Confusion with foam-filled casters"** - Mixing up E2219 with E2217. Fix: E2219 is for SOLID URETHANE (self-skinning foam) casters, while E2217 is for FOAM-FILLED (urethane foam filling inside regular tire shell) casters. They are different constructions. E2219 is firmer and more durable. Specify caster tire type clearly. *(Under Review)*
