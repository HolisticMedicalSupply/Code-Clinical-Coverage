# E2230 - Manual Standing System

## Clinical Overview

Manual standing system/frame that attaches to manual wheelchair. Allows patient to achieve standing position while secured to wheelchair. Used for therapeutic standing program goals: pressure relief, bone density maintenance, orthostatic tolerance.

**Function:** Converts wheelchair to standing position through manual mechanism. Patient secured in standing frame attached to wheelchair base.

**Therapeutic Goals:** Pressure ulcer prevention/treatment, bone density maintenance (osteoporosis), orthostatic tolerance training, improved circulation, improved bowel/bladder function.

**Critical Coverage Difference:** Medicare does NOT cover. NY Medicaid MAY cover with extensive documentation.

## Coverage

**Medicare: NON-COVERED**
- Medicare does not consider standing systems to meet DME definition
- Not primarily medical in nature per Medicare policy
- Use GY modifier (statutorily excluded, no patient liability) when billing to document non-coverage

**NY Medicaid: May Be Covered (Conditional)**
- Requires prior approval
- Extensive documentation required:
  - PT/OT evaluation documenting therapeutic standing program
  - Specific medical goals (pressure relief, bone density, orthostatic tolerance)
  - Standing schedule and duration
  - Contraindications ruled out
  - Why other interventions insufficient
  - Expected outcomes and measurement plan

**Documentation Required (for Medicaid):**
- Complete PT/OT evaluation with therapeutic standing program
- Medical diagnosis requiring standing (osteoporosis, pressure ulcers)
- Specific therapeutic goals and expected outcomes
- Standing protocol (frequency, duration, progression)
- Contraindications assessment (orthostatic hypotension, fracture risk, etc.)
- Why alternative interventions insufficient
- Caregiver training plan for safe use
- Prior approval from NY Medicaid
