**NY Medicaid: May Be Covered (Conditional)**
- Requires prior approval
- Extensive documentation required:
  - PT/OT evaluation documenting therapeutic standing program
  - Specific medical goals (pressure relief, bone density, orthostatic tolerance)
  - Standing schedule and duration
  - Contraindications ruled out
  - Why other interventions insufficient
  - Expected outcomes and measurement plan

**Documentation Required (for Medicaid):**
- Complete PT/OT evaluation with therapeutic standing program
- Medical diagnosis requiring standing (osteoporosis, pressure ulcers)
- Specific therapeutic goals and expected outcomes
- Standing protocol (frequency, duration, progression)
- Contraindications assessment (orthostatic hypotension, fracture risk, etc.)
- Why alternative interventions insufficient
