# K0108 - Wheelchair Component or Accessory, NOS

## Clinical Overview

Miscellaneous wheelchair component or accessory not otherwise specifiedâ€”for items without a specific HCPCS code. Must be medically necessary for wheelchair function or patient's medical condition. Used only when no existing HCPCS code describes the item.

**When to Use K0108:**
- Unique wheelchair component/accessory not described by existing HCPCS codes
- New technology or specialized equipment without assigned code
- Custom modification medically necessary but not coded elsewhere

**When NOT to Use K0108:**
- Item has existing HCPCS code (use that code instead)
- Item is bundled with other codes (not separately billable)
- Item is not medically necessary (convenience item)

**High Scrutiny:** K0108 requires detailed justification, often manual review, and frequently requires prior authorization.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered case-by-case when item medically necessary and no existing HCPCS code applies. Requires Detailed Product Description (DPD) and extensive documentation. Often requires prior authorization or manual review for pricing/coverage determination *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.
