# E0952 - Toe Loop/Holder

## Clinical Overview

Toe loop/holder for toe positioning, preventing foot slippage. For spasticity causing toe abnormalities or foot deformities requiring toe positioning.

**Same Requirements as E0951:** Included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable as replacement only. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**Included Initially:** Included in wheelchair base at initial issue - NOT separately billable when provided with new wheelchair.

**Replacement:** Separately billable as replacement only. Use RB modifier. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. Document spasticity or deformities causing toe abnormalities requiring positioning. Document need for toe positioning to prevent foot slippage. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement with RB modifier.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. Document spasticity or foot deformities causing toe abnormalities. Document need for toe positioning. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial issue"** - Included in wheelchair base initially. NOT separately billable when provided with new wheelchair. Only bill as replacement after initial delivery.

2. **"No spasticity/deformity documented"** - Must document toe abnormalities due to spasticity or deformities requiring positioning to prevent foot slippage.

3. **"No positioning need documented"** - Document specific need for toe positioning to prevent foot slippage from footrest.
