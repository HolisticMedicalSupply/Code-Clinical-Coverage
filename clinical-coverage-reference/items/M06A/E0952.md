# E0952 - Toe Loop/Holder

## Clinical Overview

The E0952 toe loop/holder is a wheelchair accessory that secures the toes and forefoot to the footrest, preventing foot slippage and maintaining proper toe positioning throughout wheelchair use. This device consists of a strap or loop that wraps across the toes or forefoot to keep the entire foot positioned safely and consistently on the footrest.

Toe loops are essential for patients with spasticity causing toe abnormalities (toe curling, claw toes, extensor posturing), foot deformities affecting toe position, or conditions that cause involuntary foot movements leading to toe slippage off footrests. Common conditions requiring toe positioning support include cerebral palsy with toe flexor spasticity, spinal cord injury with lack of toe control, and neuromuscular conditions causing progressive toe deformities. Without toe loop support, patients risk toe slippage off the footrest, which can lead to toe/foot injury from contact with wheels or floor, improper foot positioning compromising sitting posture, and difficulty maintaining feet on footrests during wheelchair mobility. Toe loops are often used in conjunction with heel loops (E0951) to provide complete foot positioning control when both toe and heel positioning are compromised. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL BILLING RESTRICTION:** Toe loops have the same billing requirements as heel loops (E0951). They are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue and are NOT separately billable when provided with a new wheelchair. They are only separately billable as replacements after the initial wheelchair delivery. This billing restriction applies to both Medicare and Medicaid. Use RB (replacement) modifier when billing separately. Frequency limit: 2 replacements in 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. Document spasticity or deformities causing toe abnormalities requiring positioning. Document need for toe positioning to prevent foot slippage. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement with RB modifier.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. Document spasticity or foot deformities causing toe abnormalities. Document need for toe positioning. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - cerebral palsy (G80.x), spinal cord injury (G82.x), contractures (M24.5x)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting toe positioning need
- [ ] Specific condition causing toe abnormalities or foot slippage: spasticity, toe deformities, involuntary movements
- [ ] Safety concerns: risk of toe/foot slipping off footrest, potential for toe injury or foot positioning problems
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] Document spasticity or foot deformities causing toe abnormalities requiring positioning to prevent foot slippage
- [ ] **If billing as REPLACEMENT:** Use RB modifier (replacement of component); verify >2.5 years since last replacement (2 in 5 years limit)
- [ ] **If billing at initial wheelchair delivery:** Do NOT bill E0952 separately - included in wheelchair base

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] Document toe positioning need and safety concerns
- [ ] **If billing as REPLACEMENT:** Verify >2.5 years since last replacement (2 in 5 years limit)
- [ ] **If billing at initial wheelchair delivery:** Do NOT bill E0952 separately - included in wheelchair base

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial issue - included in wheelchair base"** - Most common error. E0952 has the same billing restriction as E0951 - it is included in the wheelchair base at initial delivery and is NOT separately billable when provided with a new wheelchair. Fix: **Only bill E0952 as a REPLACEMENT after the initial wheelchair delivery.** Use RB (replacement of component) modifier when billing separately. Verify that wheelchair was previously delivered and toe loop is being replaced, not provided initially. At initial wheelchair setup, toe loops must be included in the wheelchair base code billing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No spasticity/deformity documented"** - Prescription requests toe loop but doesn't specify what toe abnormalities or foot condition requires toe positioning. Fix: **Document specific spasticity or foot deformities causing toe abnormalities.** Describe the medical condition requiring toe positioning: "Patient has toe flexor spasticity (G80.x cerebral palsy) causing involuntary toe curling and claw toe positioning; requires toe loop to maintain toes on footrest and prevent foot slippage" or "Patient with progressive toe deformities (M24.5x contractures) preventing consistent forefoot contact with footrest." Explain why the patient cannot maintain toe position without the device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No positioning need documented"** - Prescription doesn't explain why toe positioning is medically necessary to prevent foot slippage. Fix: **Document specific need for toe positioning to prevent foot slippage from footrest.** Explain the functional problem: "Toe loop required to prevent foot slippage off footrest due to [spasticity/deformities]; patient unable to maintain forefoot contact with footrest independently, leading to improper foot positioning and risk of toe injury from wheel contact." Include description of what happens without toe loop support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Exceeded frequency limit"** - Requesting replacement before 2.5 years (frequency: 2 in 5 years). Fix: Verify timing - last E0952 provided more than 2.5 years ago. If requesting earlier replacement, document specific medical necessity: "Toe loop damaged due to daily use with severe toe spasticity causing excessive wear on strap; replacement required for continued safe foot positioning." *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Same billing restriction as E0951:** Toe loops included in wheelchair base initially - only bill separately as replacements *(verified from source)*
- **Use RB modifier for replacements:** When billing separately, always use RB (replacement of component) modifier *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document specific toe condition:** Describe spasticity or deformities causing toe abnormalities - generic "needs toe loop" insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Explain foot slippage risk:** Describe how toe abnormalities lead to foot slippage off footrest and associated safety concerns *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify frequency compliance:** 2 in 5 years limit - ensure >2.5 years since last replacement *(verified from source)*
- **Match ICD-10 to condition:** Use appropriate codes - G80.x for CP with toe spasticity, G82.x for SCI, M24.5x for toe contractures *(verified from source)*
- **Consider combined with E0951:** If both toe and heel positioning compromised, both E0951 and E0952 may be appropriate *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same billing restriction as Medicare:** Included in wheelchair base initially, only bill separately as replacements *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order required:** Use NY Medicaid fiscal order format *(verified from source)*
- **Document positioning and safety:** Both are required - why toe positioning needed AND safety risks if not used *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify frequency limit:** 2 in 5 years - same as Medicare *(verified from source)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios for E0952:**
- Cerebral palsy with toe flexor spasticity causing toe curling/claw toes *(verified from source)*
- Spinal cord injury with lack of voluntary toe/forefoot control *(verified from source)*
- Progressive neuromuscular conditions with toe deformities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Combined with E0951 when both toe and heel positioning required for complete foot support *(Under Review)*
