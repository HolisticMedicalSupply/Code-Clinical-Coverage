# E2212 - Tube for Pneumatic Propulsion Tire

## Clinical Overview

E2212 represents replacement inner tubes for pneumatic (air-filled) propulsion tires on manual wheelchair rear wheels. Inner tubes are essential components of the pneumatic tire system, holding the air pressure that provides cushioning and shock absorption. Tubes can fail due to punctures from sharp objects, valve stem damage, age-related deterioration, or improper inflation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Pneumatic tire systems (tire + tube) offer superior ride quality and shock absorption compared to foam-filled or solid tires, but require regular maintenance including proper inflation and occasional tube replacement. Tubes are included with pneumatic tires at initial wheelchair issue; E2212 is only separately billable when replacing damaged tubes on an existing wheelchair with pneumatic propulsion tires (E2211). Tubes are NOT used with foam-filled (E2216) or solid (E2218) tires. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code for pneumatic tire systems. Inner tubes are included initially with pneumatic propulsion tires (E2211). E2212 is only separately billable when replacing punctured/worn tubes. Patient must have pneumatic propulsion tires - not applicable for foam-filled or solid tire systems. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Pneumatic tire system:** Patient's wheelchair has pneumatic (air-filled) propulsion tires (E2211) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Tube damage/failure:** Inner tube punctured, valve damaged, or deteriorated requiring replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Functional need:** Tube replacement necessary to maintain pneumatic tire function and wheelchair mobility *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document tube failure (puncture, valve damage, air leak, deterioration)
- Confirm patient has pneumatic propulsion tires (E2211)
- Document patient's continued need for pneumatic tire system
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both rear wheels if replacing both)

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue (included with pneumatic tires)
- Only applicable for pneumatic tire systems - NOT for foam-filled or solid tires
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- Tube lifespan varies based on usage, terrain, and maintenance
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement only for pneumatic tire systems *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Patient has pneumatic propulsion tires (E2211)
- Tube damage/failure requiring replacement

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document tube failure (puncture, valve damage, air leak)
- Confirm patient has pneumatic tires, not foam-filled or solid
- RB modifier for replacement billing
- Quantity (typically 2 for pair)

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only - not billable at initial wheelchair issue
- Only for pneumatic tire systems
- Document specific tube failure reason

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2212 - Wheelchair accessory, tube for pneumatic propulsion tire, any size, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Specify 1 or 2 (single tube vs. pair for both rear wheels)
- [ ] Tube size (match existing pneumatic propulsion tire size)
- [ ] Evidence of tube failure (puncture, valve damage, air leak)
- [ ] Confirm patient has pneumatic propulsion tires (E2211), not foam-filled or solid
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair
- [ ] Specify tube failure reason (puncture, valve damage, deterioration)

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Document tube failure clearly
- [ ] Confirm pneumatic tire system

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included with pneumatic tires"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue or initial tire replacement. Fix: E2212 is REPLACEMENT ONLY for existing pneumatic tire systems. Only bill when replacing damaged tubes on wheelchair already equipped with pneumatic propulsion tires (E2211). Use RB modifier. If replacing entire tire + tube system, bill E2211 (tire) and E2212 (tube) separately with RB modifier on each. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Patient does not have pneumatic tires"** - Patient has foam-filled or solid tires. Fix: Inner tubes are ONLY for pneumatic (air-filled) tire systems. If patient has foam-filled tires (E2216) or solid tires (E2218), they do not have inner tubes - those tire types do not require tubes. Document patient's current tire type. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Insufficient documentation of tube failure"** - No evidence of tube damage. Fix: Document specific tube failure: puncture from sharp object (nail, glass, thorn), valve stem damage preventing air retention, age-related deterioration causing slow leaks, or improper inflation causing damage. Include symptom timeline (when flat tire noticed, frequency of re-inflation needed). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2212 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME (pneumatic tire system). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Tire not separately billed"** - Billing tube alone when tire also needs replacement. Fix: If BOTH tire and tube need replacement (tire worn out), bill both E2211 (pneumatic propulsion tire) AND E2212 (tube) separately, each with RB modifier. Tubes and tires are billed as separate line items, not combined. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Always use **RB modifier** to indicate replacement part *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill appropriate quantity: 1 tube if replacing single wheel, 2 tubes if replacing both rear wheels *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Confirm pneumatic tire system** - document patient has pneumatic propulsion tires (E2211) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document tube failure clearly: puncture, valve damage, air leak, deterioration *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If replacing both tire AND tube, bill E2211 and E2212 separately (not combined) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify tube size to match existing pneumatic tires *(Under Review)*
- Ensure replacement is within wheelchair's 5-year reasonable useful lifetime *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Confirm patient has pneumatic tires, not foam-filled or solid *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document tube failure reason (puncture, valve damage, leak) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify quantity and tube size *(Under Review)*
- If replacing tire and tube together, bill separately with RB on each *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
