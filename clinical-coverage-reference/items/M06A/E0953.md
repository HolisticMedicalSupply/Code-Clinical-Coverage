## Clinical Overview

Lateral thigh/knee support for postural asymmetries, hip ad/abduction abnormalities, or spasticity affecting leg positioning.

**PT/OT Evaluation Required:** Must have PT/OT evaluation documenting asymmetries, measurements, and inadequacy of alternatives.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. **PT/OT evaluation required** documenting postural asymmetries, measurements showing need, inadequacy of alternatives. Frequency: 2 per wheelchair every 5 years.

## Common Denials

1. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** - PT/OT evaluation required documenting asymmetries and measurements.
2. **"No documentation of inadequacy of alternatives"** - Must show why other positioning options insufficient.
