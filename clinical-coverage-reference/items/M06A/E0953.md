# E0953 - Lateral Thigh/Knee Support

## Clinical Overview

Lateral thigh/knee support for postural asymmetries, hip adduction/abduction abnormalities, or spasticity affecting leg positioning. Provides lateral support to maintain proper leg positioning in wheelchair.

**PT/OT Evaluation Required:** Must have PT/OT evaluation documenting postural asymmetries, specific measurements showing need, and inadequacy of less costly alternatives.

**Frequency:** 2 per wheelchair every 5 years.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. **PT/OT evaluation required** documenting:
- Postural asymmetries requiring lateral leg support
- Specific measurements showing need for lateral support
- Inadequacy of alternatives (standard positioning options insufficient)

Frequency: 2 per wheelchair every 5 years.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. **PT/OT evaluation required** documenting:
- Postural asymmetries or hip adduction/abduction abnormalities
- Specific measurements demonstrating need
- Why standard positioning options are inadequate

Frequency: 2 per wheelchair every 5 years.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** - PT/OT evaluation is required. Must include documentation of postural asymmetries and specific measurements.

2. **"No documentation of inadequacy of alternatives"** - Must document why standard positioning options (armrests, cushioning) are insufficient for lateral leg support needs.

3. **"No measurements documented"** - Specific measurements showing postural asymmetries and leg positioning needs are required in PT/OT evaluation.

4. **"Exceeded frequency limit"** - Limited to 2 per wheelchair every 5 years. Document medical necessity if requesting earlier replacement.
