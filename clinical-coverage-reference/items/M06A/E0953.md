# E0953 - Lateral Thigh/Knee Support

## Clinical Overview

The E0953 lateral thigh/knee support is a wheelchair positioning accessory that provides lateral (side-to-side) support to the thigh and/or knee to correct postural asymmetries and maintain proper leg alignment in the wheelchair. This device consists of a padded support with mounting hardware that attaches to the wheelchair frame to prevent unwanted hip adduction (legs crossing inward), hip abduction (legs splaying outward), or lateral leg drift due to asymmetric muscle tone or positioning abnormalities.

Lateral thigh/knee supports are essential for patients with postural asymmetries requiring lateral leg support, including conditions such as cerebral palsy with asymmetric spasticity, spinal cord injury with imbalanced muscle tone, muscular dystrophy with progressive postural changes, hemiplegia causing one-sided leg positioning problems, and severe contractures creating fixed lateral leg deviations. These patients cannot maintain neutral leg alignment without external support, leading to sitting instability, pressure ulcer risk from asymmetric weight distribution, difficulty with wheelchair mobility, and progressive postural deformities if left uncorrected. Lateral supports maintain proper leg alignment to optimize sitting posture, prevent secondary complications, and support functional wheelchair use. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - PT/OT EVALUATION REQUIRED:** Unlike basic foot positioning accessories (E0951, E0952), lateral thigh/knee supports require a comprehensive PT/OT evaluation documenting postural asymmetries, specific measurements showing the need for lateral support, and documentation that less costly alternatives (standard armrests, cushioning adjustments) are inadequate. This evaluation is mandatory for coverage by both Medicare and Medicaid. The PT/OT must provide specific measurements of postural asymmetry (e.g., degrees of lateral tilt, measurements of hip adduction/abduction angles) and explain why standard wheelchair positioning options cannot address the patient's lateral leg support needs. Frequency limit: 2 per wheelchair every 5 years. *(verified from source)*

- [ ] Specific measurements of postural asymmetry (hip adduction/abduction angles, lateral tilt degrees)
- [ ] Documentation why standard positioning options inadequate
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation MUST document:**
  - [ ] Postural asymmetries requiring lateral thigh/knee support
  - [ ] Specific measurements showing need (hip angles, lateral tilt measurements)
  - [ ] Inadequacy of less costly alternatives (standard armrests, cushioning adjustments)
  - [ ] Medical necessity for lateral support vs. standard positioning options
- [ ] Verify frequency compliance: 2 per wheelchair every 5 years

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation MUST document** (same requirements as Medicare):
  - [ ] Postural asymmetries and measurements
  - [ ] Why standard positioning options insufficient
  - [ ] Specific lateral support needs
- [ ] Verify frequency compliance: 2 per wheelchair every 5 years

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No PT/OT evaluation submitted"** - Most common denial for E0953. PT/OT evaluation is REQUIRED for coverage - this is not optional. Prescription alone is insufficient. Fix: **Submit comprehensive PT/OT evaluation documenting postural asymmetries, specific measurements, and inadequacy of alternatives.** The evaluation must be performed by a licensed physical therapist or occupational therapist and must include: (1) specific measurements of postural asymmetry (e.g., "patient exhibits 15° left lateral pelvic tilt with associated left hip adduction of 10° requiring lateral left thigh support"), (2) documentation that patient cannot maintain neutral leg alignment without external support, (3) explanation why standard wheelchair positioning (armrests, cushioning) inadequate. PT/OT signature, credentials, and date required on evaluation. *(verified from source - PT/OT evaluation explicitly required)*

2. **"PT/OT evaluation inadequate - no measurements documented"** - Evaluation submitted but lacks specific measurements of postural asymmetries and leg positioning needs. Fix: **PT/OT evaluation must include specific measurements** showing postural asymmetries: hip adduction/abduction angles in degrees, lateral pelvic tilt measurements, leg alignment measurements, thigh/knee positioning angles. Generic statement "patient has asymmetries" is insufficient. Example: "Patient exhibits right hip abduction of 20° with inability to maintain midline leg position; left hip adduction of 15° with thigh crossing midline; lateral pelvic tilt 12° to right. Standard armrests inadequate to prevent lateral leg drift; lateral thigh support required to maintain neutral alignment." Measurements demonstrate medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No documentation of inadequacy of alternatives"** - PT/OT evaluation doesn't explain why standard positioning options (armrests, standard cushioning) are insufficient for lateral leg support needs. Fix: **PT/OT must document why less costly alternatives inadequate.** Explain what was tried and why it failed: "Standard wheelchair armrests do not provide lateral thigh support due to patient's [specific condition]; attempted positioning with additional cushioning but asymmetric tone overcomes cushion resistance; lateral thigh support required to maintain leg alignment that standard components cannot achieve." Must demonstrate that standard wheelchair positioning options were considered and are insufficient. *(verified from source - inadequacy of alternatives must be documented)*

4. **"Exceeded frequency limit"** - Requesting replacement/additional lateral supports before allowed frequency. Limited to 2 per wheelchair every 5 years. Fix: Verify timing - more than 2.5 years since last lateral supports for this wheelchair. If requesting earlier replacement due to wheelchair change, damage, or medical necessity, document specifically: "Patient received new wheelchair [date]; lateral supports required for new chair" or "Existing lateral support damaged; replacement required for continued positioning." Note: "2 per wheelchair every 5 years" allows 2 supports per individual wheelchair during 5-year period. *(verified from source)*

5. **"PT/OT evaluation not by qualified therapist"** - Evaluation not completed by licensed PT or OT. Fix: Evaluation must be performed by licensed physical therapist (PT) or occupational therapist (OT). Include therapist credentials, license number, and signature on evaluation. Physician assessment alone insufficient - PT/OT specialty evaluation required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **PT/OT evaluation is MANDATORY** - this is the most critical requirement; without it, claim will be denied *(verified from source)*
- **Include specific measurements:** Hip adduction/abduction angles, lateral pelvic tilt degrees, thigh/knee positioning angles *(verified from source)*
- **Document inadequacy of alternatives:** Explain why standard armrests, cushioning adjustments cannot address lateral support needs *(verified from source)*
- **Use qualified PT/OT:** Licensed physical therapist or occupational therapist - include credentials and license number *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Comprehensive evaluation:** Don't submit brief note - need detailed assessment of postural asymmetries and positioning needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify frequency:** 2 per wheelchair every 5 years - ensure compliance before ordering *(verified from source)*
- **Match ICD-10 to condition:** Use codes reflecting postural asymmetry conditions - G80.x (CP), G82.x (SCI), G81.x (hemiplegia) *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same PT/OT evaluation requirement as Medicare** - mandatory for Medicaid coverage *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order required:** Use NY Medicaid fiscal order format *(verified from source)*
- **Comprehensive measurements required:** Same measurement requirements as Medicare *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document alternatives inadequate:** Same requirement to document why standard options insufficient *(verified from source)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios for E0953:**
- Cerebral palsy with asymmetric spasticity causing hip adduction/abduction abnormalities *(verified from source)*

**PT/OT Evaluation Best Practices:**
- **Be specific with measurements:** "15° left lateral tilt" not "some tilt" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document functional impact:** Explain how asymmetry affects sitting, mobility, pressure distribution *(Under Review)*
- **Explain why standard options fail:** "Standard armrests positioned too high to provide thigh support; cushioning alone inadequate to counteract spasticity forces" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Include trial information if applicable:** "Attempted positioning with standard components for 2 weeks; patient continued to exhibit lateral drift requiring external support" *(Under Review)*
