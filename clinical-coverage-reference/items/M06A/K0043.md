# K0043 - Footrest, Lower Extension Tube, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement lower extension tube component of footrest assembly. For component replacement when lower tube damaged/worn but rest of footrest assembly functional.

**Component Replacement:** Lower extension tube only (not complete footrest assembly). More economical than replacing complete assembly (K0045) when only this component damaged.

**Footrest Assembly Components:**
- K0044: Upper hanger bracket
- K0043: Lower extension tube
- K0042: Footplate
- K0045: Complete assembly (all components)

**Replacement Only:** Included at initial issue. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Bundling:** K0043 bundled with K0045, K0046, and elevating legrests at initial issue.

**Unit:** Each (one tube). Typically bill as pair (2 units) if both footrest tubes need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when lower extension tube damaged and component replacement more appropriate than complete assembly. Justify why component vs. complete assembly (K0045). RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document lower extension tube damage and justify component replacement vs. complete assembly replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Lower extension tube damage/wear (bent, cracked, broken)
- Rest of footrest assembly still functional
- Justification why component replacement sufficient vs. complete assembly (K0045)
- RB modifier (replacement)
