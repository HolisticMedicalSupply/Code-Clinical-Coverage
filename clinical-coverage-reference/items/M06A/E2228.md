# E2228 - Wheel Braking System and Lock, Complete

## Clinical Overview

Complete wheel braking system with caliper or disc brake for manual wheelchair. Provides controlled descent on inclines and full wheel lock. For users requiring enhanced safety beyond standard wheel locks when navigating slopes.

**Enhanced Braking:** Caliper or disc brake system provides gradual speed control on descents (not just on/off like standard locks). More sophisticated than standard wheel locks (E2206).

**Safety on Slopes:** Critical for patients navigating ramps, hills, or inclines at home or in community where standard locks insufficient.

**Separately Billable:** Not automatically includedâ€”must justify medical necessity and environmental requirements.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when medically necessary for safe wheelchair use. Must document environmental needs (ramps, inclines in home/community) and why standard wheel locks inadequate.

**NY Medicaid:** Prior approval may be required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document specific environmental terrain requiring enhanced braking system. Justify upgrade from standard locks.

**Documentation Required:**
- Specific environmental needs (home/community ramps, inclines, slopes)
- Grade/steepness of inclines patient must navigate
- Why standard wheel locks (E2206) inadequate for safe descent
- Patient's ability (or inability) to safely control descent with standard locks
- Safety concerns with standard lock system
- Type of braking system (caliper vs. disc) and justification
