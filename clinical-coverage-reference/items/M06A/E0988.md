# E0988 - Lever-Activated Wheel Drive, Pair

## Clinical Overview

The E0988 lever-activated wheel drive system is an alternative propulsion mechanism for manual wheelchairs that replaces standard handrims with lever-activated drives allowing patients with upper extremity impairments to propel wheelchairs when standard handrim propulsion is not possible. The lever system uses mechanical advantage through lever arms that require different hand/arm motions than circular handrim pushing, making wheelchair propulsion feasible for patients unable to use standard handrims.

Lever-activated drives are medically necessary for patients with upper extremity impairment preventing standard handrim propulsion due to severe arthritis limiting grip strength and causing pain with handrim grasp/push, severe hand/wrist pain preventing sustained handrim contact, significant UE weakness preventing generation of force required for handrim propulsion, single upper extremity functional (hemiplegia) making bilateral handrim propulsion impossible, or upper extremity amputation affecting handrim grasp/manipulation ability. These UE impairments make standard manual wheelchair propulsion impossible despite desire for independent mobility, and lever-activated drives provide alternative propulsion method matching patient's functional capabilities. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL TWO-PART COVERAGE TEST:** Lever-activated drives covered ONLY if patient meets BOTH criteria: **(1) CANNOT use standard handrims** due to documented UE impairment (arthritis, pain, weakness, single functional UE, amputation), AND **(2) CAN use lever-activated system** (demonstrated capability to operate lever mechanism for wheelchair propulsion). Both conditions are mandatory - if patient can use standard handrims, lever drives NOT covered (not medically necessary); if patient cannot use lever drives, they're NOT covered (ineffective for patient). *(verified from source - covered when cannot use standard but can use lever)*

**PT/OT EVALUATION REQUIRED:** Comprehensive PT/OT evaluation documenting BOTH parts of coverage test - inability with standard handrims AND successful lever system trial. *(verified from source)* **NY Medicaid PA recommended.** *(verified from source)* **Unit = Pair** (billed as single unit for both wheels). *(verified from source)* Frequency: 1 in 5 years. *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. PT/OT evaluation documenting: (1) Cannot use standard handrims (arthritis, pain, weakness, single UE functional, hemiplegia), AND (2) CAN use lever-activated system. Trial beneficial to demonstrate capability with lever mechanism. Frequency: 1 in 5 years (billed as pair).

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. **Prior authorization recommended.** PT/OT evaluation required documenting: (1) Standard handrim inability due to UE impairment (arthritis, weakness, pain, single functional UE), and (2) Lever system trial showing successful operation. Frequency: 1 in 5 years (billed as pair).

- [ ] Verify frequency: 1 in 5 years

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient can use standard handrims - lever not medically necessary"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL. Patient able to use standard handrims (even with difficulty), making lever-activated system convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: **Document that patient CANNOT use standard handrims due to documented UE impairment.** Must prove true inability, not just preference. Include objective measurements: grip strength (unable to generate force required for handrim push), ROM limitations (unable to achieve wrist/elbow positions for handrim grasp), arthritis severity with pain scores (severe pain preventing handrim contact), functional assessment (PT/OT attempted handrim propulsion - patient unable to propel wheelchair). Example: "Patient with bilateral hand OA (M19.x) has grip strength 8 lbs right, 6 lbs left (normal 60-100 lbs); pain score 8/10 with handrim contact; PT assessment documents inability to propel wheelchair using standard handrims due to inadequate grip strength and pain; lever-activated system allows propulsion using different mechanics." If patient can use handrims (even with effort), lever drives not medically necessary. *(verified from source - Part 1 of two-part test)*

2. **"No PT/OT evaluation or incomplete evaluation"** - PT/OT evaluation missing OR evaluation doesn't document BOTH parts of two-part test. Fix: **Submit comprehensive PT/OT evaluation documenting BOTH inability with standard handrims AND successful lever system trial.** PT/OT evaluation must include: (1) **Handrim inability assessment:** Functional trial with standard handrims showing patient cannot propel wheelchair; objective measurements (grip strength, ROM, pain levels); specific UE limitations preventing handrim use. (2) **Lever system trial:** Demonstration with lever-activated drives showing patient CAN successfully propel wheelchair using lever mechanism; document trial results (distance propelled, ease of use, patient feedback, functional capability). Both parts required in PT/OT evaluation - missing either part results in denial. PT/OT signature and credentials required. *(verified from source - PT/OT evaluation required documenting both parts)*

3. **"No lever system trial documented - capability not demonstrated"** - Evaluation documents handrim inability but doesn't include lever system trial showing patient can use lever drives. Fix: **Document successful trial with lever-activated system.** PT/OT must trial patient with actual lever-activated drives (or similar demonstration system) to verify patient can operate lever mechanism for wheelchair propulsion. Document trial specifics: "Patient trialed with lever-activated wheel drive system; successfully propelled wheelchair 50 feet using lever mechanism; demonstrated adequate strength and coordination for lever operation; reports lever system feasible for independent mobility unlike standard handrims." Trial proves Part 2 of two-part test - patient CAN use lever system. Without trial documentation, cannot verify lever system appropriate for patient. *(verified from source - Part 2 of two-part test, lever trial required)*

4. **"UE impairment not specific enough"** - Generic statement "patient has arthritis" without objective severity measurements demonstrating handrim impossibility. Fix: **Provide specific objective measurements of UE impairment.** Include: grip strength measurements (in lbs or kg), ROM measurements (wrist extension/flexion, elbow flexion/extension), arthritis severity (joint involvement, radiographic findings), pain assessment (VAS scores with handrim contact), functional strength testing. Example: "Bilateral hand OA with DIP/PIP joint involvement; grip strength: right 10 lbs, left 8 lbs (inadequate for handrim propulsion requiring 40+ lbs force); wrist extension ROM: right 20°, left 15° (limited, normal 60-70°); pain 8/10 with hand closure." Objective measurements demonstrate severity preventing handrim use. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Frequency limit exceeded"** - Requesting replacement before 5 years. Fix: Verify timing >5 years since last E0988. If early replacement needed: "Lever system provided [date]; system damaged/worn requiring replacement for continued independent mobility." Lever-activated drives durable equipment with 5-year expected lifespan. *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document BOTH parts of two-part test:** Cannot use handrims AND can use lever - both mandatory *(verified from source - most critical requirement)*
- **PT/OT evaluation is REQUIRED:** Not recommended - REQUIRED; claims without PT/OT evaluation denied *(verified from source)*
- **Objective measurements strengthen Part 1:** Grip strength, ROM, pain scores prove handrim inability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Actual trial critical for Part 2:** Must trial with lever system, not just theory *(verified from source)*
- **Verify unit = pair:** Bill as pair (both wheels), not separately *(verified from source)*
- **Verify frequency:** 1 in 5 years *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **PA recommended:** Verify if PA required; if so, obtain before ordering *(verified from source)*
- **Same two-part test as Medicare:** Cannot use handrims AND can use lever *(verified from source)*
- **PT/OT evaluation REQUIRED:** Same as Medicare *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order required:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*

**Two-Part Test Breakdown:**
- **Part 1 (Cannot use handrims):** Arthritis, pain, weakness, single UE, amputation preventing handrim propulsion *(verified from source)*
- **Part 2 (Can use levers):** Trial showing successful lever operation for wheelchair propulsion *(verified from source)*
- **Both required:** Missing either part = denial *(verified from source)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios:**
- Severe bilateral hand/wrist OA preventing handrim grasp *(verified from source)*
- Hemiplegia with single functional UE (cannot operate bilateral handrims) *(verified from source)*
