# E0988 - Lever-Activated Wheel Drive, Pair

## Clinical Overview

Lever-activated wheel drive system (pair) for UE impairment preventing standard handrim propulsion. For arthritis, pain, weakness, single UE functional, or hemiplegia requiring alternate propulsion.

**Covered When Cannot Use Standard But Can Use Lever:** Must demonstrate inability to use standard handrims but ability to use lever system.

**PT/OT Evaluation Required:** Documenting inability with standard rims and lever trial.

**Unit = Pair:** Billed as pair (both wheels).

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Written order. PT/OT evaluation documenting: (1) Cannot use standard handrims (arthritis, pain, weakness, single UE), (2) CAN use lever-activated system (trial beneficial). Frequency: 1 in 5 years (pair).

**Medicaid:** Fiscal order. **PA recommended.** PT/OT evaluation required documenting standard handrim inability and lever system trial. Frequency: 1 in 5 years (pair).

## Common Denials

1. **"Can use standard handrims"** - Must document inability to use standard handrims due to UE impairment.
2. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** - PT/OT evaluation required documenting handrim inability and lever system trial.
3. **"No trial documented"** - Trial with lever system beneficial to demonstrate capability.
