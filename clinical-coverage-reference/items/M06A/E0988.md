# E0988 - Lever-Activated Wheel Drive, Pair

## Clinical Overview

Lever-activated wheel drive system (pair) for upper extremity impairment preventing standard handrim propulsion. For arthritis, pain, weakness, single UE functional, or hemiplegia requiring alternate propulsion method.

**Two-Part Coverage Test:** (1) Cannot use standard handrims due to UE impairment, AND (2) CAN use lever-activated system. Both conditions must be demonstrated.

**PT/OT Evaluation Required:** Documenting inability with standard handrims and successful lever system trial.

**Unit = Pair:** Billed as pair (both wheels together), not individually.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. PT/OT evaluation documenting: (1) Cannot use standard handrims (arthritis, pain, weakness, single UE functional, hemiplegia), AND (2) CAN use lever-activated system. Trial beneficial to demonstrate capability with lever mechanism. Frequency: 1 in 5 years (billed as pair).

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. **Prior authorization recommended.** PT/OT evaluation required documenting: (1) Standard handrim inability due to UE impairment (arthritis, weakness, pain, single functional UE), and (2) Lever system trial showing successful operation. Frequency: 1 in 5 years (billed as pair).

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Can use standard handrims"** - Must document specific UE impairment preventing standard handrim use. Include grip strength measurements, ROM limitations, arthritis severity, pain levels preventing handrim grasp/propulsion. Cannot approve if patient able to use standard handrims.

2. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** - PT/OT evaluation required documenting both handrim inability AND lever system capability. Evaluation must include functional assessment of handrim propulsion attempt and lever trial results.

3. **"No trial documented"** - Trial with lever-activated system required to demonstrate patient can successfully operate lever mechanism. Document trial results showing effective propulsion with levers despite handrim inability.
