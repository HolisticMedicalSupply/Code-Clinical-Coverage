# E2216 - Foam Filled Propulsion Tire

## Clinical Overview

E2216 represents replacement foam-filled propulsion tires for the rear wheels of manual wheelchairs. Foam-filled tires are puncture-proof tires filled with solid urethane foam instead of air, eliminating the need for inner tubes and preventing flat tires. They provide a maintenance-free alternative to pneumatic (air-filled) tires, ideal for active users or patients in environments with high puncture risks. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Foam-filled tires offer a middle ground between pneumatic and solid tires: they provide more cushioning than solid rubber/plastic tires but less shock absorption than fully inflated pneumatic tires. They are heavier than pneumatic tires but eliminate puncture concerns and maintenance. Foam-filled tires are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue; E2216 is only separately billable when replacing worn tires OR when upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled due to documented medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is typically a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Foam-filled propulsion tires are usually included in the wheelchair base at initial issue. E2216 is separately billable when replacing worn foam-filled tires OR when upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled with medical justification (puncture risk environment, maintenance difficulties, active outdoor use). Must justify foam-filled vs. pneumatic option. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Tire wear/damage OR upgrade need:** Foam-filled tires worn/damaged OR patient requires upgrade from pneumatic to foam-filled *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Medical justification (if upgrading):** Foam-filled tires medically necessary vs. pneumatic option due to puncture risk, maintenance difficulties, or active use pattern *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document tire wear/damage (if replacing existing foam-filled tires) OR justification for foam-filled vs. pneumatic (if upgrading)
- If upgrading: Explain why foam-filled preferred over pneumatic (puncture risk environment, inability to maintain pneumatic tires, active outdoor use, repeated puncture history)
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (outdoor activities, terrain, environment)
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both rear wheels)

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue unless medically justified over standard tire option
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- If upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled, document medical necessity
- Foam-filled tires do NOT require inner tubes
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement or medically justified upgrade *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Tire wear/damage OR medical necessity for foam-filled option
- Appropriate for patient's wheelchair use pattern

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document tire wear/damage (if replacing) OR justification for foam-filled (if upgrading)
- Patient's usage pattern (outdoor use, puncture risk environment, maintenance considerations)
- RB modifier for replacement billing
- Quantity (typically 2 for pair)

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only OR medically justified upgrade from pneumatic
- Document clear medical reason if changing tire type
- Foam-filled provides flat-free benefit for active users

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2216 - Wheelchair accessory, foam filled propulsion tire, any size, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both rear wheels)
- [ ] Tire size (e.g., 24", 25", 26" - match existing wheelchair)
- [ ] Evidence of tire wear/damage (if replacing existing foam-filled) OR justification for foam-filled vs. pneumatic (if upgrading)
- [ ] Patient's wheelchair use pattern (active outdoor use, puncture risk environment)
- [ ] Medical necessity for foam-filled tire type
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair
- [ ] Justify foam-filled tire type vs. pneumatic option
- [ ] If upgrading: Document why foam-filled medically necessary

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Document tire wear/damage OR justification for foam-filled
- [ ] Specify tire size and quantity

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue without justification. Fix: E2216 is typically included in wheelchair base at initial issue. Only bill separately when replacing worn foam-filled tires on existing wheelchair OR when upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled with documented medical necessity. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient justification for foam-filled vs. pneumatic"** - No medical reason for foam-filled tire choice. Fix: If upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled, document specific medical necessity: repeated punctures with pneumatic tires, patient/caregiver unable to maintain proper tire inflation, puncture-risk environment (outdoor terrain with debris/thorns), active wheelchair user requiring flat-free reliability, or remote location without puncture repair access. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Tire wear not documented"** - Replacing foam-filled tires without evidence of wear. Fix: Document specific tire wear/damage: tread completely worn down, foam deterioration visible, sidewall damage, tire separation from rim, or age-related hardening. Foam-filled tires typically last several years - if replacing sooner, document premature wear reason (heavy use, rough terrain, manufacturing defect). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2216 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Patient has pneumatic tires - wrong code"** - Billing foam-filled when patient needs pneumatic tire insert. Fix: Do NOT confuse E2216 (foam-filled propulsion tire) with E2213 (insert for pneumatic tire). E2216 is for complete foam-filled tires. If patient has pneumatic tires and needs flat-free insert, use E2213. If patient needs complete foam-filled tire replacement, use E2216. *(Under Review)*
