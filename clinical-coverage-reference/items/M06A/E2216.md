# E2216 - Foam Filled Propulsion Tire

## Clinical Overview

Foam-filled propulsion tire for rear wheels of manual wheelchair. Puncture-proof, maintenance-free alternative to pneumatic tires. For active users or environments with puncture risks.

**Foam-Filled vs. Pneumatic:** Foam-filled tires are flat-free and require no maintenance but provide less shock absorption than pneumatic (air-filled) tires. Heavier than pneumatic.

**Foam-Filled vs. Solid:** Foam-filled tires offer some cushioning compared to solid rubber/plastic tires while maintaining flat-free benefit.

**Replacement Only:** Tires included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both rear wheels.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when tires worn or when foam-filled option medically justified. Document need for foam-filled vs. pneumatic (flat-free benefit, maintenance concerns, puncture risk environment).

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Justify foam-filled vs. pneumatic tire choice based on patient needs and environment.

**Documentation Required:**
- Tire wear/damage requiring replacement OR
- Medical justification for foam-filled vs. pneumatic option
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern and environment
- Active user status or puncture risk factors
- RB modifier (replacement)
