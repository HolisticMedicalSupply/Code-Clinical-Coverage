# E0990 - Elevating Leg Rest, Complete Assembly

## Clinical Overview

Elevating leg rest complete assembly for patients meeting ONE of THREE criteria: (1) musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion, (2) significant LE edema requiring elevation, OR (3) reclining back on wheelchair.

**Must Meet ONE of Three Criteria:** Coverage requires meeting at least one criterion.

**NOT Included in Manual Wheelchair Base:** Separately billable (unlike some accessories included at initial issue).

**E0990 vs. K0195:** E0990 for purchased wheelchairs. K0195 for capped rental wheelchairs (same criteria).

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. **Must meet ONE of three criteria:**
1. **Musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion** - Document condition, cast/brace, inability to flex knee 90°
2. **Significant LE edema requiring elevation** - Document edema with measurements (circumference, pitting)
3. **Reclining back on wheelchair** - Document patient has reclining back (E1226 or manual recline)

PT assessment helpful. Frequency: 2 in 5 years (pair).

## Common Denials

1. **"No criteria met"** - Must meet ONE of three criteria. Document musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° flexion OR edema measurements OR reclining back.
2. **"Can achieve 90° knee flexion"** - If using criteria 1, must document inability to achieve 90° knee flexion.
3. **"Edema not significant"** - If using criteria 2, document significant edema with measurements justifying elevation need.
4. **"No reclining back"** - If using criteria 3, document wheelchair has reclining back system.
