# E0990 - Elevating Leg Rest, Complete Assembly

## Clinical Overview

Elevating leg rest complete assembly for patients meeting **ONE of THREE criteria**: (1) musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion, (2) significant lower extremity edema requiring elevation, OR (3) reclining back on wheelchair.

**Must Meet ONE of Three Criteria:** Coverage requires meeting at least one criterion. Document which criterion applies.

**NOT Included in Manual Wheelchair Base:** Separately billable accessory (unlike some accessories included at initial issue). Can bill at initial wheelchair dispensing when criteria met.

**E0990 vs. K0195:** E0990 for purchased wheelchairs. K0195 for capped rental wheelchairs. Same clinical criteria apply to both codes.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. **Must meet ONE of three criteria:**

1. **Musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion** - Document specific condition (knee arthritis, contracture, post-surgical), cast/brace presence, ROM measurements showing inability to achieve 90° flexion required for standard footrests

2. **Significant LE edema requiring elevation** - Document edema with measurements (circumference at ankle/calf, pitting edema grade), medical necessity for leg elevation during wheelchair use for edema management

3. **Reclining back on wheelchair** - Document patient has reclining back system (E1226 fully reclining >80° or manual recline). Elevating legrests required to maintain leg support when back reclined

PT assessment helpful for documenting criteria. Frequency: 2 in 5 years (pair). Medicare LCD L33792.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Must meet ONE of three criteria (same as Medicare). Document: musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion with ROM measurements, OR significant edema measurements requiring elevation, OR reclining back system. Frequency: 2 in 5 years (pair).

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - knee pain/stiffness (M25.56x), lymphedema (I89.0), venous insufficiency (I87.2), leg fractures (S82-S89), knee contracture (M24.56x)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting need for elevating legrests
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Identify which of THREE criteria applies** (must meet at least ONE)
- [ ] **Criterion 1:** Musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion (include ROM measurements)
- [ ] **Criterion 2:** Significant LE edema requiring elevation (include edema measurements)
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** Reclining back on wheelchair (document reclining back system code)
- [ ] PT assessment helpful for documenting criteria
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] Document which criterion applies (must meet ONE of three):
  - [ ] Criterion 1: Document ROM <90° knee flexion, or cast/brace preventing flexion
  - [ ] Criterion 2: Document edema measurements (circumference, pitting grade) requiring elevation
  - [ ] Criterion 3: Document reclining back system (E1226 or manual recline)
- [ ] NOT included in manual wheelchair base - separately billable even at initial issue when criteria met
- [ ] E0990 for purchased wheelchair, K0195 for capped rental
- [ ] Verify frequency: 2 in 5 years (pair)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] Same three-criteria documentation as Medicare
- [ ] Document which criterion applies
- [ ] Verify frequency: 2 in 5 years (pair)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No criteria met - medical necessity not documented"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL. Request for elevating legrests without documenting which of three criteria applies. Fix: **Clearly identify which criterion applies and provide supporting documentation.** Criterion 1: "Patient has knee contracture (M24.56x) with knee ROM 60° (unable to achieve 90° flexion required for standard footrests); elevating legrests required to accommodate knee positioning." Criterion 2: "Patient has significant LE lymphedema (I89.0) with ankle circumference 16" right, 15" left (normal 10"); calf circumference 20" right, 19" left (normal 14"); pitting edema 3+; elevating legrests medically necessary for leg elevation during wheelchair use for edema management." Criterion 3: "Patient has reclining back system (E1226 fully reclining); elevating legrests required to maintain leg support when back reclined." Must document at least ONE criterion with supporting evidence. *(verified from source - must meet ONE of three criteria)*

2. **"Can achieve 90° knee flexion - Criterion 1 not met"** - If using Criterion 1, must prove inability to achieve 90° knee flexion. Fix: **Document ROM measurements showing inability to achieve 90° knee flexion.** Include: knee flexion ROM measurement in degrees (must be <90°), description of limiting condition (arthritis causing pain at flexion, contracture preventing flexion, cast/brace requiring extended knee position, post-surgical restrictions), why standard footrests cannot accommodate knee position. Example: "Patient post-knee surgery (S82.x) with cast requiring extended knee position; cannot flex knee to 90° required for standard footrests; elevating legrests accommodate extended knee position required by cast." ROM measurements prove inability. If knee flexion ≥90°, standard footrests adequate - elevating legrests not medically necessary. *(verified from source - Criterion 1)*

3. **"Edema not significant enough - Criterion 2 not met"** - If using Criterion 2, edema mentioned but not documented as significant requiring elevation. Fix: **Document SIGNIFICANT edema with measurements.** Include: circumference measurements showing edema (ankle circumference, calf circumference - compare to normal or contralateral limb), pitting edema grade (1+ to 4+), underlying cause (lymphedema, venous insufficiency, CHF), medical necessity for elevation during wheelchair use for edema management, physician recommendation for elevation. Example: "Patient with bilateral LE lymphedema (I89.0) - ankle circumference: right 17" left 16" (normal ~10"), calf circumference: right 21" left 20" (normal ~14"); pitting edema 3+; physician recommends leg elevation during wheelchair use for edema control; elevating legrests medically necessary for therapeutic elevation." Measurements demonstrate significance. Minor edema not requiring elevation doesn't meet criterion. *(verified from source - Criterion 2)*

4. **"No reclining back documented - Criterion 3 not met"** - If using Criterion 3, must document wheelchair has reclining back system. Fix: **Document reclining back system on wheelchair.** Include specific reclining back code: E1226 (fully reclining back >80°) or manual recline code, explain why elevating legrests medically necessary when back reclines (legs must elevate with back recline to maintain support - standard footrests inadequate when back reclined). Example: "Patient has wheelchair with fully reclining back system (E1226); back reclines >80° for pressure relief and positioning; elevating legrests medically necessary to maintain leg support and proper positioning when back reclined; standard footrests inadequate during recline." Reclining back system makes elevating legrests medically necessary component. *(verified from source - Criterion 3)*

5. **"Frequency limit exceeded"** - Requesting replacement before 2.5 years (frequency: 2 in 5 years for pair). Fix: Verify timing >2.5 years since last elevating legrests (E0990 or K0195). If early replacement needed: "Elevating legrests provided [date]; damaged/worn requiring replacement for continued [edema management / knee positioning / reclining support]." *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Identify criterion clearly:** State which of three criteria applies upfront *(verified from source - most important)*
- **Criterion 1 - ROM measurements:** Document degrees of knee flexion (<90°) with ROM measurement *(verified from source)*
- **Criterion 2 - Edema measurements:** Circumferences and pitting grade prove significance *(verified from source)*
- **Criterion 3 - Reclining back code:** Document specific code (E1226 or recline code) *(verified from source)*
- **PT assessment helpful:** Strengthens documentation of criteria *(verified from source)*
- **NOT included in base:** Separately billable even at initial issue when criteria met *(verified from source)*
- **E0990 vs. K0195:** E0990 for purchased, K0195 for capped rental - same criteria *(verified from source)*
- **Verify frequency:** 2 in 5 years (pair) *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same three criteria as Medicare:** Must meet ONE *(verified from source)*
- **Same documentation requirements:** ROM, edema measurements, or reclining back *(Under Review)*
- **Fiscal order required:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*

**Three Criteria Summary:**
