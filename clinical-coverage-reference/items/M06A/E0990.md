# E0990 - Elevating Leg Rest, Complete Assembly

## Clinical Overview

Elevating leg rest complete assembly for patients meeting **ONE of THREE criteria**: (1) musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion, (2) significant lower extremity edema requiring elevation, OR (3) reclining back on wheelchair.

**Must Meet ONE of Three Criteria:** Coverage requires meeting at least one criterion. Document which criterion applies.

**NOT Included in Manual Wheelchair Base:** Separately billable accessory (unlike some accessories included at initial issue). Can bill at initial wheelchair dispensing when criteria met.

**E0990 vs. K0195:** E0990 for purchased wheelchairs. K0195 for capped rental wheelchairs. Same clinical criteria apply to both codes.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. **Must meet ONE of three criteria:**

1. **Musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion** - Document specific condition (knee arthritis, contracture, post-surgical), cast/brace presence, ROM measurements showing inability to achieve 90° flexion required for standard footrests

2. **Significant LE edema requiring elevation** - Document edema with measurements (circumference at ankle/calf, pitting edema grade), medical necessity for leg elevation during wheelchair use for edema management

3. **Reclining back on wheelchair** - Document patient has reclining back system (E1226 fully reclining >80° or manual recline). Elevating legrests required to maintain leg support when back reclined

PT assessment helpful for documenting criteria. Frequency: 2 in 5 years (pair). Medicare LCD L33792.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Must meet ONE of three criteria (same as Medicare). Document: musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion with ROM measurements, OR significant edema measurements requiring elevation, OR reclining back system. Frequency: 2 in 5 years (pair).

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No criteria met"** - Must meet ONE of three criteria. Document which criterion applies: musculoskeletal/cast/brace preventing 90° flexion, OR significant edema measurements, OR reclining back system.

2. **"Can achieve 90° knee flexion"** - If using criterion 1, must document inability to achieve 90° knee flexion required for standard footrests. Include ROM measurements, description of limiting condition (arthritis, contracture, cast, brace).

3. **"Edema not significant"** - If using criterion 2, document significant edema requiring elevation. Include measurements (circumference differences, pitting grade), medical necessity for elevation during wheelchair use for edema control.

4. **"No reclining back"** - If using criterion 3, document wheelchair has reclining back system (E1226 or manual recline code). Elevating legrests medically necessary to support legs during back recline.
