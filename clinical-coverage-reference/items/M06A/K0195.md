# K0195 - Elevating Leg Rests, Pair (for Capped Rental Wheelchair Base)

## Clinical Overview

Elevating leg rests, billed as pair (both legs), for use with capped rental wheelchair bases. Same coverage criteria as E0990/K0053: must meet one of three specific criteria related to knee flexion, edema, or reclining back.

**Must Meet ONE of Three Criteria:**
1. Musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion; presence of cast/brace at knee, OR
2. Significant lower extremity edema requiring elevation, OR
3. Beneficiary has reclining back on wheelchair

- **E0990:** Used for purchased wheelchairs
- **Same coverage criteria** for both codes

**Bundling:** K0195 bundled with:
- E0990 (elevating leg rests for purchase)
- E0995 (calf rest/pad replacement)
- K0042-K0047 (footrest components)
- Power seating systems (when provided with power tilt/recline)

**Unit:** Pair (both leg rests billed as 1 unit, not 2 each).

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when patient meets one of three criteria. Physician order and medical records documenting edema measurements/musculoskeletal limitation/reclining back required. PT/OT evaluation recommended for positioning assessment. Covered with wheelchair rental period.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when patient meets one of three criteria. Voluntary prior authorization available for power mobility accessories *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. PT/OT evaluation recommended. Document specific criterion met.
