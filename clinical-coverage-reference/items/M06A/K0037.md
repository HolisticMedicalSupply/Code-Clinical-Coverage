# K0037 - High Mount Flip-Up Footrest

## Clinical Overview

High mount flip-up footrest for manual or power wheelchair. Footrests flip up and out of the way to facilitate transfers. Higher mounting position than standard footrests for shorter stature patients or specific transfer methods.

**Flip-Up Function:** Footrests swing upward/outward to clear path for transfers (slide transfers, stand-pivot transfers, assisted transfers).

**High Mount:** Mounted higher on wheelchair frame than standard footrests. Used for:
- Shorter stature patients requiring proper foot positioning
- Transfer methods requiring higher footrest clearance

**Coverage Complexity:**
- **Manual wheelchairs:** Included in base—not separately billable
- **Power Groups 1-2:** May be separately billable
- **Power Groups 3-5:** Bundled (included)—not separately billable

**Unit:** Each (one footrest). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both sides.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** May be separately billable for power Groups 1-2 if medically necessary. Included/bundled in manual bases and power Groups 3-5. Document transfer method requiring flip-up function and justify high-mount vs. standard footrest height.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when flip-up function necessary for safe transfers. Document specific transfer method and why high-mount positioning needed.

**Documentation Required:**
- Transfer method (slide transfer, stand-pivot, assisted)
- Why flip-up footrests necessary for safe transfers
- If high-mount: Patient measurements (leg length, stature) justifying higher mounting
- Functional assessment of transfers with and without flip-up footrests
- Note wheelchair type and group (for power wheelchairs)
