# E2217 - Foam Filled Caster Tire

## Clinical Overview

E2217 represents replacement foam-filled caster tires for the front wheels of manual wheelchairs. Foam-filled casters are puncture-proof tires filled with solid urethane foam instead of air, eliminating the need for inner tubes and preventing flat tires. They provide a maintenance-free alternative to pneumatic (air-filled) casters, ideal for active users or patients in environments with high puncture risks. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Casters are the smaller front wheels (typically 6-8 inches) that provide steering and stability. Foam-filled casters offer a middle ground between pneumatic and solid casters: they provide more cushioning than solid rubber/plastic casters but less shock absorption than fully inflated pneumatic casters. Foam-filled casters are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue; E2217 is only separately billable when replacing worn casters OR when upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled due to documented medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is typically a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Foam-filled caster tires are usually included in the wheelchair base at initial issue. E2217 is separately billable when replacing worn foam-filled casters OR when upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled with medical justification (puncture risk environment, maintenance difficulties, active use). Must justify foam-filled vs. pneumatic option. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Caster tire wear/damage OR upgrade need:** Foam-filled casters worn/damaged OR patient requires upgrade from pneumatic to foam-filled *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Medical justification (if upgrading):** Foam-filled casters medically necessary vs. pneumatic option due to puncture risk, maintenance difficulties, or active use pattern *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document caster tire wear/damage (if replacing existing foam-filled) OR justification for foam-filled vs. pneumatic (if upgrading)
- If upgrading: Explain why foam-filled preferred over pneumatic (puncture risk environment, inability to maintain pneumatic casters, active outdoor use)
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (outdoor activities, terrain, environment)
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both front casters)

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue unless medically justified over standard caster option
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- If upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled, document medical necessity
- Foam-filled casters do NOT require inner tubes
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement or medically justified upgrade *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Caster tire wear/damage OR medical necessity for foam-filled option
- Appropriate for patient's wheelchair use pattern

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document caster tire wear/damage (if replacing) OR justification for foam-filled (if upgrading)
- Patient's usage pattern (outdoor use, puncture risk environment, maintenance considerations)
- RB modifier for replacement billing
- Quantity (typically 2 for pair)

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only OR medically justified upgrade from pneumatic
- Document clear medical reason if changing caster type
- Foam-filled provides flat-free benefit for active users

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2217 - Wheelchair accessory, foam filled caster tire, any size, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both front casters)
- [ ] Caster tire size (e.g., 6", 7", 8" - match existing wheelchair)
- [ ] Evidence of caster tire wear/damage (if replacing existing foam-filled) OR justification for foam-filled vs. pneumatic (if upgrading)
- [ ] Patient's wheelchair use pattern (active outdoor use, puncture risk environment)
- [ ] Medical necessity for foam-filled caster type
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair
- [ ] Justify foam-filled caster type vs. pneumatic option
- [ ] If upgrading: Document why foam-filled medically necessary

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Document caster tire wear/damage OR justification for foam-filled
- [ ] Specify caster tire size and quantity

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue without justification. Fix: E2217 is typically included in wheelchair base at initial issue. Only bill separately when replacing worn foam-filled casters on existing wheelchair OR when upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled with documented medical necessity. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient justification for foam-filled vs. pneumatic casters"** - No medical reason for foam-filled caster choice. Fix: If upgrading from pneumatic to foam-filled, document specific medical necessity: repeated punctures with pneumatic casters, patient/caregiver unable to maintain proper caster inflation, puncture-risk environment (outdoor terrain with debris), active wheelchair user requiring flat-free reliability, or maintenance access difficulties. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Caster tire wear not documented"** - Replacing foam-filled casters without evidence of wear. Fix: Document specific caster tire wear/damage: tread completely worn down, foam deterioration visible, sidewall damage, caster wobble, or age-related hardening. Casters wear differently than propulsion tires due to swiveling motion. Document wear timeline. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2217 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Wrong tire type or location"** - Confusion between caster and propulsion tires. Fix: E2217 is for CASTER (front wheel) tires only. For rear propulsion wheel foam-filled tires, use E2216. Specify location clearly (front casters vs. rear propulsion wheels). *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Always use **RB modifier** to indicate replacement part *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill 2 units (pair) if replacing both front casters *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify foam-filled caster type** - explain why foam-filled preferred over pneumatic *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document patient's use pattern: active outdoor use, puncture-risk environment, maintenance difficulties *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If replacing existing foam-filled: Document caster tire wear/damage clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If upgrading from pneumatic: Document medical necessity (repeated punctures, inability to maintain, active use) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify caster tire size to match wheelchair (typically 6", 7", or 8") *(Under Review)*
- Ensure replacement is within wheelchair's 5-year reasonable useful lifetime *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify foam-filled caster choice clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document puncture risk environment or maintenance concerns *(Under Review)*
- Specify caster tire size and quantity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain flat-free benefit for patient's active lifestyle or environment *(Under Review)*
