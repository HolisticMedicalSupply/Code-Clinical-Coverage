# E2217 - Foam Filled Caster Tire

## Clinical Overview

Foam-filled caster tire for front wheels of manual wheelchair. Puncture-proof, maintenance-free alternative to pneumatic casters. For active users or environments with puncture risks.

**Foam-Filled Caster Benefits:** Flat-free, no air required, provides moderate cushioning compared to solid casters. Heavier than pneumatic but no maintenance.

**Caster Location:** Front wheels (typically smaller than rear propulsion wheels).

**Replacement Only:** Caster tires included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one caster tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when caster tires worn or damaged. Foam-filled option appropriate for flat-free benefit and active users.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document tire wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Caster tire wear or damage
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (active use, puncture risk environment)
- RB modifier (replacement)
