# K0071 - Front Caster Assembly, Complete, With Pneumatic Tire, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Complete front caster assembly replacement with pneumatic (air-filled) tire for beneficiary-owned manual wheelchair. Includes caster fork, wheel rim, pneumatic tire, tube, and bearings. For replacement when medically necessary for shock absorption and outdoor use.

**Complete Caster Assembly:** Includes all caster components:
- Caster fork (E2226)
- Caster wheel rim (E2225)
- Pneumatic caster tire (E2214)
- Inner tube (E2215)
- Bearings and hardware

**Pneumatic Caster:** Air-filled front caster providing:
- Shock absorption over uneven surfaces
- Smoother ride quality
- Outdoor terrain capability
- Better performance on rough surfaces

**Medical Justification Required:** Must document why pneumatic casters medically necessary vs. solid/foam casters. Patient's environment and wheelchair use must require pneumatic performance.

**Unit:** Each (one caster assembly). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters if both need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when medically justified for shock absorption and outdoor terrain needs. Document wheelchair environment/use requires pneumatic casters vs. solid/foam options. SWO and proof of ownership required. RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Prior approval may be required if cost exceeds threshold *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Justify pneumatic casters based on patient's functional needs and environment.

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of wheelchair ownership
- Wheelchair still meets coverage criteria
- Caster assembly damage or wear requiring replacement
- Medical justification for pneumatic casters:
  - Outdoor use over uneven terrain (describe surfaces)
  - Shock absorption needs (medical condition, comfort, function)
  - Patient's typical environment requiring pneumatic performance
- Why pneumatic vs. solid/foam casters (K0072, K0077) necessary
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (indoor/outdoor, terrain types)
- SWO (Standard Written Order) before delivery
- RB modifier (replacement)
