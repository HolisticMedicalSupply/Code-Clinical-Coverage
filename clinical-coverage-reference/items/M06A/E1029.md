# E1029 - Ventilator Tray, Fixed

## Clinical Overview

Fixed ventilator tray for ventilator-dependent wheelchair users. For tracheostomy with portable ventilation, chronic respiratory failure, ALS, muscular dystrophy, SCI with ventilator dependence.

**Ventilator Dependence Required:** Patient must be ventilator-dependent with portable ventilator.

**Fixed Mounting:** Use E1030 (gimbaled) if patient has reclining back wheelchair requiring horizontal ventilator positioning during recline.

**NY Medicaid PA May Be Required.**

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. Document: (1) Ventilator dependence (Z99.11), (2) Portable ventilator prescription, (3) Justification for fixed mounting vs. gimbaled (E1030), (4) Continuous need during wheelchair use. NY Medicaid PA may be required.

## Common Denials

1. **"No ventilator dependence documented"** - Must document ventilator dependence (Z99.11) with portable ventilator prescription.
2. **"No continuous need documented"** - Document continuous ventilator use during wheelchair mobility.
3. **"Reclining back - E1030 appropriate"** - If wheelchair has reclining back, E1030 (gimbaled) may be required instead of E1029 (fixed).
4. **"No justification for fixed mounting"** - Document why fixed tray appropriate (vs. gimbaled E1030 if reclining back).
