## Clinical Overview

Replacement upper hanger bracket component of footrest assembly. For component replacement when upper bracket damaged/worn but rest of footrest assembly functional.

**Component Replacement:** Upper hanger bracket only (attaches footrest to wheelchair frame). More economical than replacing complete assembly (K0045) when only bracket damaged.

- K0042: Footplate
- K0045: Complete assembly (all components)

**Replacement Only:** Included at initial issue. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Bundling:** K0044 bundled with K0045 and K0047 at initial issue.

**Unit:** Each (one bracket). Typically bill as pair (2 units) if both footrest brackets need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when upper hanger bracket damaged and component replacement more appropriate than complete assembly. Justify component vs. complete assembly (K0045). RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document upper hanger bracket damage and justify component replacement vs. complete assembly replacement.
