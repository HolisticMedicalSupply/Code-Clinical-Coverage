# E1226 - Manual Fully Reclining Back (>80°)

## Clinical Overview

The E1226 manual fully reclining back is a wheelchair accessory that allows the wheelchair back to recline greater than 80 degrees from vertical (approaching horizontal position), providing maximum reclining capability for pressure relief, positioning, or medical necessity. This manually-operated reclining back uses mechanical mechanisms (cables, levers, or handles) that caregivers operate to adjust back angle, distinguished from E1225 semi-reclining back (15-80°) by greater recline angle.

Manual fully reclining backs (>80°) are medically necessary for wheelchair users who meet at least ONE of THREE specific Medicare LCD criteria and require greater recline angle than semi-reclining provides. Criteria include: (1) High risk for pressure ulcers with inability to perform independent functional weight shifts (patients unable to relieve pressure independently requiring prolonged recline for pressure redistribution), (2) Intermittent catheterization with inability to independently transfer from wheelchair to bed (patients requiring catheterization positioning achieved through wheelchair recline when bed transfer impossible), or (3) Unable to tolerate upright wheelchair position due to orthostatic hypotension or medical positioning intolerance (patients requiring reclined positioning for medical stability). Greater than 80-degree recline provides maximum positioning options for these medical needs that semi-reclining (15-80°) cannot achieve. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**MEDICARE LCD L33792 - MUST MEET ONE OR MORE OF THREE CRITERIA:** (1) Pressure ulcer risk AND inability to weight shift, OR (2) Intermittent catheterization AND inability to transfer to bed, OR (3) Inability to tolerate upright position/orthostatic hypotension. At least ONE criterion required. *(verified from source)* **NOT SEPARATELY BILLABLE AT INITIAL ISSUE:** Included in wheelchair base cost at initial delivery. Separately billable as replacement/upgrade after initial issue. *(verified from source)* **Specialty evaluation recommended:** Physician/PT/OT evaluation documenting criterion and necessity. *(verified from source)* **Must justify >80° vs. semi-reclining (E1225 15-80°).** *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare LCD L33792: Covered when patient meets at least ONE of three criteria. Physician/PT/OT specialty evaluation recommended documenting: specific criterion met, necessity for >80° recline, inability to weight shift (Criterion 1), catheterization schedule and transfer inability (Criterion 2), or positioning intolerance/orthostatic hypotension (Criterion 3), why semi-reclining (E1225) inadequate. NOT separately billable at initial wheelchair issue - included in base cost initially. *(verified from source)*

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Prior approval recommended. Same three-criteria system as Medicare - document which criterion applies. Must justify why >80° recline necessary vs. E1225 semi-reclining. *(verified from source)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] **IDENTIFY WHICH CRITERION APPLIES** - must meet at least ONE of three
- [ ] **Criterion 1:** Pressure ulcer risk assessment AND inability to weight shift documentation
- [ ] **Criterion 2:** Catheterization schedule AND inability to transfer to bed documentation
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** Positioning intolerance OR orthostatic hypotension documentation
- [ ] **Justify >80° recline vs. E1225 (15-80°)** - why semi-reclining inadequate
- [ ] Specialty evaluation recommended (Physician/PT/OT)
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] Meets at least ONE criterion (Medicare LCD L33792)
- [ ] Specialty evaluation documenting criterion and necessity
- [ ] Justify >80° vs. semi-reclining
- [ ] **NOT separately billable at initial issue** - only as replacement/upgrade

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] Prior approval recommended
- [ ] Same criterion documentation as Medicare
- [ ] Justify >80° vs. E1225

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No criterion met - medical necessity not documented"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL. E1226 requested without documenting which of three Medicare LCD criteria patient meets. Fix: **Clearly identify which criterion applies and provide supporting documentation.** Criterion 1: "Patient has stage 2 pressure ulcer (L89.x) at high risk for worsening; unable to perform independent weight shifts due to quadriplegia (G82.5x); requires >80° recline for prolonged pressure redistribution that semi-reclining cannot provide." Criterion 2: "Patient requires intermittent catheterization (N31.9 neurogenic bladder) 4 times daily; unable to independently transfer from wheelchair to bed for catheterization; requires >80° wheelchair recline to achieve positioning necessary for catheterization procedure." Criterion 3: "Patient has orthostatic hypotension (I95.1); cannot tolerate upright wheelchair positioning; requires >80° recline to maintain blood pressure stability and prevent syncope." Must meet at least ONE criterion with documentation. *(verified from source - must meet ONE OR MORE criteria)*

2. **"Criterion documented but inadequately - missing key elements"** - Prescription mentions criterion but lacks required supporting documentation. Fix: **For Criterion 1:** Include pressure ulcer risk assessment (Braden Scale, existing ulcers with stage, high-risk factors), documentation of inability to weight shift (PT/OT assessment showing patient cannot perform independent pressure reliefs, specific limitations preventing weight shifts). **For Criterion 2:** Include catheterization schedule (frequency, times per day, technique), documentation of inability to transfer to bed (PT/OT transfer assessment showing patient cannot independently transfer wheelchair to bed, specific transfer barriers, why recline necessary for catheterization positioning). **For Criterion 3:** Include orthostatic hypotension documentation (blood pressure measurements supine vs. sitting/standing showing significant drop, symptoms with upright positioning) OR positioning intolerance medical reason (pain, respiratory compromise, etc. with upright position). Complete documentation of chosen criterion. *(verified from source - specialty evaluation documenting necessity)*

3. **"Semi-reclining (E1225) would be adequate - >80° not justified"** - E1226 requested but documentation doesn't justify why >80° recline necessary vs. E1225 semi-reclining (15-80°). Fix: **Explicitly document why >80° recline medically necessary vs. semi-reclining.** Explain: "Patient requires near-horizontal positioning (>80° recline) for effective pressure relief; semi-reclining (15-80°) provides insufficient angle to redistribute pressure from ischial tuberosities; >80° recline necessary to approach supine position for adequate pressure relief duration" OR "Catheterization procedure requires near-flat positioning; semi-reclining angle inadequate for proper catheter placement; >80° recline necessary to achieve positioning required for safe catheterization technique." Demonstrate that semi-reclining insufficient and greater angle required. *(verified from source - document why semi-reclining insufficient)*

4. **"Billed at initial wheelchair issue"** - E1226 billed separately when wheelchair first delivered. E1226 is included in wheelchair base cost at initial issue and NOT separately billable at initial delivery. Fix: **Only bill E1226 separately as replacement or upgrade after initial wheelchair delivery.** At initial wheelchair setup, fully reclining back is included in wheelchair base code if medically necessary - cannot be unbundled and billed separately at initial issue. E1226 separately billable only when: (1) replacing worn/damaged reclining back on existing wheelchair, or (2) upgrading from non-reclining to reclining back after initial delivery when medical condition changes necessitating reclining capability. Document timing and reason for separate billing. *(verified from source - not separately billable at initial issue)*
