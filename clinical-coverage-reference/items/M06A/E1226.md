# E1226 - Manual Fully Reclining Back (>80°)

## Clinical Overview

Manual fully reclining back for wheelchair, reclines greater than 80 degrees from vertical. For patients who meet at least one of three specific criteria related to pressure management, catheterization, or positioning tolerance.

**Must Meet ONE OR MORE Criteria:**
1. High risk for pressure ulcers AND unable to perform functional weight shift
2. Intermittent catheterization AND unable to independently transfer wheelchair to bed
3. Unable to tolerate upright position OR orthostatic hypotension

**Distinguish from E1225:** E1225 is semi-reclining (15-80°). E1226 is fully reclining (>80°). Must document why greater recline needed.

## Coverage

**Medicare LCD L33792:** Covered when patient meets at least one of three criteria. Physician/PT/OT specialty evaluation documenting necessity, inability to weight shift, catheterization schedule, or pressure ulcer risk.

**Not Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base cost at initial delivery. Separately billable as replacement or upgrade after initial issue.

**NY Medicaid:** Prior approval recommended. Document specific criterion met and why semi-reclining insufficient.

**Documentation Required:**
- Specific criterion met (1, 2, or 3)
- For Criterion 1: Pressure ulcer risk assessment, inability to weight shift
- For Criterion 2: Catheterization schedule, inability to transfer to bed
- For Criterion 3: Medical reason for positioning intolerance, orthostatic hypotension documentation
- Why semi-reclining (E1225) inadequate
- PT/OT evaluation recommended *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
