# E2220 - Solid Rubber/Plastic Propulsion Tire

## Clinical Overview

Solid rubber or plastic propulsion tire for rear wheels of manual wheelchair. Hard construction for maximum durability and maintenance-free operation. Primarily for indoor use on smooth surfaces.

**Solid Construction:** Hard rubber or plastic (no air, no foam). Firmest ride quality but most durable and maintenance-free.

**Minimal Cushioning:** Provides least shock absorption compared to pneumatic or foam options. Best for smooth indoor surfaces.

**Replacement Only:** Tires included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both rear wheels.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when tires worn or damaged. Solid rubber/plastic appropriate for maximum durability and maintenance-free needs, primarily indoor use.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document tire wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Tire wear or damage requiring replacement
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (primarily indoor, smooth surfaces)
- Justification for solid tire vs. cushioned options (if applicable)
- RB modifier (replacement)
