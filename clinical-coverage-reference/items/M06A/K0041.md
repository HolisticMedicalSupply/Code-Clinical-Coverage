## Clinical Overview

Large size footplate for wheelchair footrest. For patients with larger foot size requiring full contact and support, or foot positioning needs to control primitive reflexes or poor posture.

- **Manual wheelchairs:** Standard footplates included in base

**Unit:** Each (one footplate). Bill separately for left and right feet as needed.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Separately billable for power wheelchairs when medically necessary. Standard footplates included in manual wheelchairs. Document foot measurements, need for full contact support, impact on positioning/reflexes.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when larger footplate medically necessary. Prior approval may be required for power wheelchairs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document foot measurements showing standard footplate inadequate.

**Documentation Required:**
- Foot measurements (length and width in cm or inches)
- Why standard footplate inadequate (insufficient support, foot extends beyond edge)
- Impact on positioning: primitive reflex control, posture support, comfort
- For cerebral palsy: PT/OT assessment of reflex patterns and positioning needs
- Photos of foot on standard footplate showing inadequacy (helpful)
