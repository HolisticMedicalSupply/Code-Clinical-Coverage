# E1028 - Swingaway/Removable Mounting Hardware

## Clinical Overview

The E1028 swingaway/removable mounting hardware is a wheelchair accessory component that provides swingaway or removable capability for wheelchair positioning accessories (arm supports, lateral supports, other positioning components) to facilitate safe patient transfers. This hardware allows positioning accessories to swing out of the way or be completely removed during transfers, then repositioned when patient is seated in wheelchair.

Swingaway/removable mounting hardware is medically necessary for patients requiring slide transfers who cannot transfer safely with fixed-mounted positioning accessories blocking transfer path, patients with severe transfer difficulty necessitating maximum clearance by removing/swinging positioning components out of the way during transfers, patients requiring safe transfers where fixed accessories create injury risk or transfer impossibility, and patients needing positioning accessories that must be removable for wheelchair function during specific activities. Common scenarios include hemiplegia patients performing slide board transfers who need lateral supports during use but must remove them for transfers, patients with severe weakness requiring maximum wheelchair access for caregiver-assisted transfers, and patients with positioning accessories who cannot safely transfer with components in place. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL - MULTIPLE BUNDLING EXCLUSIONS:** DO NOT bill E1028 separately with E1020 (residual limb support - swingaway included), E0950 (wheelchair tray - swingaway included), or E2325 (already includes swingaway). These items include swingaway mounting in their base codes. *(verified from source)* **NEW CODES EFFECTIVE 4/1/2025:** E1032, E1033, E1034 for specific applications - verify if newer codes apply instead of E1028. *(verified from source)* **PT/OT evaluation required** documenting transfer method and swingaway necessity. *(verified from source)* **KA modifier** (add-on code). *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. PT/OT evaluation documenting: (1) Transfer method - slide transfer, stand-pivot, dependent transfer, specific technique requiring clearance, (2) Why swingaway/removable mounting necessary for safe transfers - explain how fixed mounting prevents safe transfers, (3) Specific positioning accessory component requiring swingaway mounting. **KA modifier required** (add-on code). **DO NOT bill with E1020, E0950, or E2325.** *(verified from source)*

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Same documentation as Medicare - PT/OT evaluation with transfer method, swingaway necessity, component identification. **Same bundling exclusions** - do not bill with E1020, E0950, E2325. *(verified from source)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - wheelchair dependence (Z99.3), hemiplegia (G81.x), paraplegia/quadriplegia (G82.x), muscle weakness (M62.81)
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation REQUIRED** - documenting transfer method and swingaway necessity
- [ ] Transfer method documented - slide transfer, stand-pivot, dependent, specific technique
- [ ] Why swingaway necessary for safe transfers
- [ ] Specific positioning accessory component requiring swingaway mounting
- [ ] **KA modifier** required (add-on code)
- [ ] **VERIFY NOT BUNDLED:** Check if billing with E1020, E0950, or E2325 (do NOT bill E1028 with these)
- [ ] **CHECK NEW CODES:** As of 4/1/2025, verify if E1032/E1033/E1034 apply instead
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation with all required elements
- [ ] KA modifier
- [ ] Verify not bundled with E1020, E0950, E2325
- [ ] Check if E1032/E1033/E1034 apply (after 4/1/2025)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] Same PT/OT evaluation requirements
- [ ] Same bundling restrictions
- [ ] KA modifier (if applicable per Medicaid rules)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed with E1020 - unbundling error"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL. E1028 billed separately with E1020 (residual limb support). This is unbundling - E1020 includes swingaway mounting and E1028 cannot be billed separately with it. Fix: **Do NOT bill E1028 with E1020.** E1020 residual limb support systems include swingaway mounting as standard feature. Only bill E1020, not E1020 + E1028 together. Same bundling restriction applies to E0950 (wheelchair tray) and E2325 - these items include swingaway mounting and cannot be billed with separate E1028. Check all codes on claim to ensure no bundling conflict. *(verified from source - do not bill with E1020, E0950, E2325)*

2. **"No PT/OT evaluation or inadequate evaluation"** - Prescription lacks PT/OT evaluation, or evaluation doesn't adequately document transfer method and swingaway necessity. Fix: **Submit comprehensive PT/OT evaluation.** Must include: (1) **Transfer method:** Describe specific transfer technique patient uses (slide board transfer, stand-pivot, dependent lift, etc.); (2) **Why swingaway necessary:** Explain how fixed-mounted positioning accessories prevent safe transfers - "Patient performs slide board transfers from wheelchair to bed; lateral thigh supports must swing away during transfers to allow board placement and patient sliding; fixed mounting blocks transfer path creating fall risk"; (3) **Component identification:** Specify which positioning accessory requires swingaway mounting. PT/OT evaluation with therapist signature and credentials required. *(verified from source - PT/OT evaluation required)*

3. **"No transfer justification - swingaway necessity not explained"** - Prescription requests swingaway hardware but doesn't explain WHY swingaway/removable capability is medically necessary for safe transfers vs. fixed mounting. Fix: **Clearly document why swingaway necessary for safe transfers.** Explain specific problem fixed mounting creates: "Patient with hemiplegia performs slide transfers with caregiver assistance; fixed-mounted arm support blocks transfer access requiring awkward positioning increasing fall risk; swingaway arm support mounting allows support to swing out of way during transfers then reposition after transfer complete, enabling safe transfer technique." Demonstrate that fixed mounting prevents safe transfers and swingaway resolves safety issue. *(verified from source - must document why swingaway necessary)*

4. **"New codes available - E1028 inappropriate"** (After 4/1/2025) - As of April 1, 2025, new codes E1032, E1033, E1034 available for specific swingaway applications. Using E1028 when more specific newer code applies. Fix: **Verify if E1032, E1033, or E1034 apply** for the specific positioning accessory requiring swingaway mounting. Source indicates new codes for specific applications effective 4/1/2025. Check code descriptors to determine if one of new codes is more appropriate than general E1028. Use most specific applicable code. If new codes don't apply, E1028 still appropriate for general swingaway hardware. *(verified from source - new codes E1032/E1033/E1034 as of 4/1/2025)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **PT/OT evaluation mandatory:** Include transfer method, swingaway necessity, component identification *(verified from source)*
- **KA modifier required:** E1028 is add-on code *(verified from source)*
- **Check bundling:** NEVER bill with E1020, E0950, E2325 *(verified from source - most critical requirement)*
- **Check new codes after 4/1/2025:** E1032/E1033/E1034 may apply instead *(verified from source)*
- **Document transfer safety:** Explain how swingaway enables safe transfers that fixed mounting prevents *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same PT/OT requirements as Medicare:** Transfer method and swingaway necessity *(verified from source)*
- **Same bundling restrictions:** Do not bill with E1020, E0950, E2325 *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order format:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*

**Bundling Exclusions (CRITICAL):**
- **E1020** - Residual limb support (includes swingaway) - DO NOT bill E1028 *(verified from source)*
- **E0950** - Wheelchair tray (includes swingaway) - DO NOT bill E1028 *(verified from source)*
- **E2325** - (includes swingaway) - DO NOT bill E1028 *(verified from source)*
