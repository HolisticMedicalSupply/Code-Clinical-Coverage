# E1028 - Swingaway/Removable Mounting Hardware

## Clinical Overview

Swingaway/removable mounting hardware for wheelchair accessories. For patients requiring slide transfers or component removal for safe transfers.

**PT/OT Evaluation Required:** Documenting transfer method and why swingaway necessary.

**KA Modifier:** Add-on code, use KA modifier.

**Do NOT Bill With:** E1020 (residual limb support - includes swingaway), E0950 (wheelchair tray), E2325. These items include swingaway mounting.

**New Codes as of 4/1/2025:** E1032/E1033/E1034 for specific applications - check if these apply instead of E1028.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. PT/OT evaluation documenting: (1) Transfer method (slide transfer, stand-pivot, etc.), (2) Why swingaway/removable mounting necessary for safe transfers, (3) Component requiring swingaway mounting. KA modifier (add-on).

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT bill with E1020 (includes swingaway), E0950, or E2325.

## Common Denials

1. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** - PT/OT evaluation required documenting transfer method and swingaway necessity.
2. **"Billed with E1020"** - Do NOT bill E1028 with E1020 - residual limb support includes swingaway mounting.
3. **"No transfer justification"** - Must document why swingaway necessary for safe transfers (slide transfer method, component removal for positioning).
