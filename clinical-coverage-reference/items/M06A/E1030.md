# E1030 - Ventilator Tray, Gimbaled

## Clinical Overview

Gimbaled ventilator tray for wheelchair use. Same indications as E1029 (fixed tray) but specifically for patients with reclining back wheelchairs where the ventilator must remain horizontal during seat back position changes.

**Key Distinction from E1029:** Gimbaled mechanism allows ventilator to remain horizontal when wheelchair reclines. Higher cost requires strong justification.

**Reclining Back Required:** Patient must have manual reclining back (E1225/E1226) or power recline system.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when patient meets E1029 criteria PLUS has reclining back wheelchair and medical need for horizontal positioning during recline.

**NY Medicaid:** Prior approval required. Must justify medical necessity for gimbaled vs. fixed mounting. Document reclining back wheelchair code.

**Documentation Required:**
- Ventilator dependence (Z99.11)
- Portable ventilator prescription
- Reclining back wheelchair (specify HCPCS code)
- Medical justification for horizontal positioning during recline
- Explanation why gimbaled necessary vs. fixed (E1029)
