# E0705 - Transfer Device

## Clinical Overview

The E0705 is a transfer device for wheelchair users with paralysis or significant bilateral lower extremity weakness who require transfer assistance. This includes slide boards, transfer discs, and other transfer aids that assist with moving from wheelchair to bed, chair, toilet, or other surfaces.

**Transfer Assistance:** For patients who cannot safely transfer independently due to paralysis (SCI, stroke), significant bilateral LE weakness (CP, MD), or other conditions preventing safe transfers.

**PURCHASE ONLY:** E0705 can only be purchased, not rented - unique restriction among wheelchair accessories.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Cannot bill E0705 separately when wheelchair is initially issued - only billable as separate item after initial wheelchair delivery.

**Billing:** E0705 billed per each (1 device). NU modifier (new purchase).

## Coverage Details

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - paralysis (G82.x), CP (G80.x), stroke (I69.x), MD (G71.0), etc.
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting inability to safely transfer
- [ ] Document transfer limitations - bilateral LE weakness, paralysis, instability
- [ ] Document safety concerns with transfers
- [ ] Verify patient has covered wheelchair
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **Written order before claim submission**
- [ ] Medical records documenting inability to safely transfer
- [ ] Document wheelchair coverage status
- [ ] **Do NOT bill separately if provided with new wheelchair at initial issue**

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Written order (fiscal order format)
- [ ] Medical records documenting transfer inability
- [ ] Document wheelchair coverage
- [ ] **Do NOT bill separately if provided with new wheelchair at initial issue**

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed with new wheelchair at initial issue"** - Most common error. E0705 billed separately when provided with new wheelchair at initial delivery. Fix: **NOT separately billable with new wheelchair at initial issue per source.** Transfer devices included in initial wheelchair package. Only bill E0705 separately if provided AFTER initial wheelchair delivery as add-on or replacement item. Cannot separate-bill at time of initial wheelchair issue. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No wheelchair coverage documented"** - E0705 billed but patient doesn't have covered wheelchair. Fix: **Accessories only covered if beneficiary has covered wheelchair per source.** Document patient has Medicare/Medicaid-covered wheelchair (K0001-K0009, E-codes). Provide wheelchair HCPCS code, date of service, coverage status. Transfer device is wheelchair accessory - requires covered wheelchair for coverage. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No documentation of transfer inability"** - Prescription requests transfer device but doesn't document why patient cannot safely transfer. Fix: **Medical records documenting inability to safely transfer required per source.** Document specific transfer limitations: paralysis level (complete/incomplete), bilateral LE weakness severity, inability to bear weight, instability during transfers, fall risk. Describe current transfer method and why unsafe without device. Include functional assessment showing transfer difficulty. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Rental billed instead of purchase"** - Claim submitted with rental modifier (RR) instead of purchase (NU). Fix: **Purchase only - cannot rent per source.** E0705 must be billed as purchase with NU modifier. No rental option available for transfer devices. Use NU (new purchase) modifier only. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No written order before claim"** - Claim submitted without written order on file. Fix: Written order required before claim submission per source. Obtain physician written order specifying E0705 transfer device before submitting claim. Order must document medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
