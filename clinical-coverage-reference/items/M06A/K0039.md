# K0039 - Leg Strap, H-Style

## Clinical Overview

H-style leg strap for wheelchair footrest. Enhanced stabilization design for patients with strong spasticity or exaggerated muscle activity. More secure than standard leg strap (K0038).

**H-Style Design:** More secure strap configuration providing enhanced control for strong spasticity. H-shaped pattern provides better stabilization than standard single strap.

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Medical need for stabilization due to strong spasticity
- Less costly alternatives (K0038 standard strap) insufficient
- Document why H-style necessary vs. standard leg strap

**Bundling:** K0039 bundled with footrest/legrest codes. K0039 includes K0038.

**Unit:** Each (one H-style strap). May be billed for single leg or both depending on need.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when medical need for stabilization due to strong spasticity and less costly alternatives insufficient. Document strong spasticity requiring H-style design and why K0038 standard strap inadequate.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when strong spasticity requires H-style stabilization. Prior approval may be required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Explain why K0038 standard strap inadequate.

**Documentation Required:**
- Lower extremity diagnosis with strong spasticity (G80.x cerebral palsy, G82.x spasticity)
- Spasticity assessment (severity, frequency, impact on positioning)
- Trial with standard leg strap (K0038) showing inadequacy
- Why H-style necessary for adequate stabilization
- Functional and safety needs requiring enhanced stabilization
- Video or photo documentation of spasticity helpful (if applicable)
