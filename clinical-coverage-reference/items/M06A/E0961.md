# E0961 - Wheel Lock Brake Extension

## Clinical Overview

Wheel lock brake extension for patients with limited reach or hand function preventing standard wheelchair lock use. For UE weakness, arthritis, or amputees who cannot operate standard wheelchair locks.

**Covered When Standard Locks Cannot Be Operated:** Must demonstrate inability to use standard wheelchair locks due to UE limitations.

**Frequency:** 2 in 5 years.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. **Covered when patient cannot operate standard wheelchair locks.** Document:
- UE limitations (weakness, arthritis, amputation, hemiplegia) preventing standard lock operation
- Safety concerns if patient cannot engage/disengage locks independently
- Demonstration that standard locks cannot be operated

Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. **Covered when patient cannot operate standard wheelchair locks.** Document:
- UE limitations preventing standard lock use
- Safety risks if wheelchair locks cannot be operated
- Why brake extension is medically necessary for safe wheelchair use

Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Can operate standard locks"** - Must document inability to operate standard wheelchair locks due to UE limitations. Patient must demonstrate inability to use standard locks.

2. **"No safety concerns documented"** - Document safety risks if patient cannot independently engage/disengage wheelchair locks (risk of wheelchair rolling, falls, transfers).

3. **"No UE limitations documented"** - Must document specific UE limitations: weakness, arthritis, amputation, hemiplegia, limited reach, or limited hand function preventing lock operation.

4. **"Exceeded frequency limit"** - Limited to 2 in 5 years. Document medical necessity if requesting earlier replacement.
