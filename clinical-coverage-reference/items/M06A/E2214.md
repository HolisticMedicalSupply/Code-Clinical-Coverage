# E2214 - Pneumatic Caster Tire, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement pneumatic (air-filled) caster tire for front wheels of manual wheelchair. Provides smoother ride over uneven surfaces and outdoor terrain. Requires inner tube (E2215).

**Caster vs. Propulsion:** Casters are front wheels (typically smaller). Propulsion tires are rear wheels (larger, used for self-propelling).

**Pneumatic Benefits:** Air-filled tires provide shock absorption and smoother ride on uneven surfaces compared to solid casters.

**Replacement Only:** Caster tires included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when caster tires worn or damaged. Pneumatic casters appropriate for outdoor use and shock absorption needs.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document tire wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Caster tire wear or damage
- Patient's wheelchair use (outdoor mobility, uneven surfaces)
- RB modifier (replacement)
- Note: E2215 (tube) billed separately if needed
