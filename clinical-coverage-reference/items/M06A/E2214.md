# E2214 - Pneumatic Caster Tire, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

E2214 represents replacement pneumatic (air-filled) caster tires for the front wheels of manual wheelchairs. Casters are the smaller front wheels (typically 6-8 inches) that provide steering and stability, while propulsion tires are the larger rear wheels used for self-propelling. Pneumatic caster tires contain inner tubes and provide shock absorption, making them ideal for outdoor use and uneven terrain. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Compared to solid or foam-filled casters, pneumatic casters offer superior ride quality and vibration dampening, particularly beneficial for patients who use their wheelchair outdoors on sidewalks, grass, gravel, or uneven surfaces. However, pneumatic casters require more maintenance (inflation, puncture repair) than solid options. Caster tires are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue; E2214 is only separately billable when replacing worn or damaged casters. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Pneumatic caster tires are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue. E2214 is only separately billable when replacing worn/damaged casters on existing wheelchair. Inner tubes (E2215) required and billed separately. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Caster tire wear/damage:** Front caster tires worn, damaged, punctured, or no longer functional *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Replacement need:** Caster replacement necessary to maintain wheelchair safety and function *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
4. **Appropriate tire type:** Pneumatic casters appropriate for patient's usage pattern (outdoor use, uneven terrain) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document caster tire wear or damage (tread wear, sidewall damage, punctures, deterioration)
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (outdoor mobility, terrain type, frequency)
- Justification for pneumatic caster type (shock absorption, outdoor use, uneven terrain)
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both front casters)
- Note: E2215 (inner tube for pneumatic caster) billed separately if replacing tubes

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue (included in base code)
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- Pneumatic casters appropriate for outdoor/uneven terrain use
- Requires inner tubes (E2215) - bill separately if replacing tubes
- Caster tire lifespan varies based on usage and terrain
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Caster tire wear/damage requiring replacement
- Appropriate for patient's wheelchair use pattern

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document caster tire wear/damage (tread wear, punctures, deterioration)
- Patient's usage pattern (outdoor mobility, terrain)
- RB modifier for replacement billing
- Quantity (typically 2 for pair)

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only - not billable at initial wheelchair issue
- Document caster tire condition and need for replacement
- Pneumatic casters provide better ride quality for outdoor use

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2214 - Wheelchair accessory, pneumatic caster tire, any size, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Typically 2 (pair for both front casters)
- [ ] Caster tire size (e.g., 6", 7", 8" - match existing wheelchair)
- [ ] Evidence of caster tire wear/damage (tread wear, punctures, sidewall damage)
- [ ] Patient's wheelchair use pattern (outdoor use, uneven terrain)
- [ ] Justification for pneumatic caster type (shock absorption, outdoor mobility)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair
- [ ] Justify pneumatic caster type vs. solid or foam-filled
- [ ] Note if inner tubes (E2215) also needed

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Document caster tire wear/damage clearly
- [ ] Specify caster tire size and quantity

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue. Fix: E2214 is REPLACEMENT ONLY. Only bill when replacing worn/damaged caster tires on existing wheelchair, not at initial wheelchair issue. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient documentation of caster tire wear"** - No evidence of tire deterioration. Fix: Document specific caster tire condition: tread wear (smooth/bald tread), sidewall cracking or damage, punctures, or age-related deterioration. Casters wear differently than propulsion tires due to swiveling motion and smaller size. Include time since last replacement if known. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Pneumatic caster not medically necessary"** - No justification for pneumatic vs. solid casters. Fix: If patient previously had pneumatic casters, replacing with same type is typically appropriate. If changing caster type, document reason: patient uses wheelchair outdoors requiring shock absorption, uneven terrain (sidewalks, grass, gravel), or medical need for vibration dampening. *(Under Review)*

4. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2214 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Inner tube not separately billed"** - Tube cost included in caster tire billing. Fix: Inner tubes (E2215) for pneumatic casters are billed separately from caster tires (E2214). If replacing both casters and tubes, bill appropriate quantity of both codes separately with RB modifier on each. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Always use **RB modifier** to indicate replacement part *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill 2 units (pair) if replacing both front casters *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document caster tire wear/damage: tread wear, sidewall damage, punctures *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify pneumatic caster type: outdoor use, uneven terrain, shock absorption needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include patient's wheelchair use pattern (outdoor mobility, terrain type) *(Under Review)*
- Specify caster tire size to match wheelchair (typically 6", 7", or 8") *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Separately bill inner tubes (E2215) if replacing** - tubes NOT included in E2214 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Ensure replacement is within wheelchair's 5-year reasonable useful lifetime *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document caster tire wear/damage clearly with specific evidence *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify caster tire size and quantity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify pneumatic caster type for patient's use pattern (outdoor, uneven terrain) *(Under Review)*
- Bill inner tubes (E2215) separately if replacing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
