# K0077 - Front Caster Assembly, Complete, With Solid Tire, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Complete front caster assembly replacement with solid tire for beneficiary-owned manual wheelchair. Includes caster fork, wheel rim, solid tire, and bearings. Flat-free, durable option primarily for indoor use on smooth terrain.

**Complete Caster Assembly:** Includes all caster components:
- Caster fork (E2226)
- Caster wheel rim (E2225)
- Solid tire (E2221 removable or E2222 integrated)
- Bearings and hardware

**Solid Tire:** Hard rubber or plastic caster tire providing:
- Flat-free operation (no air, no punctures)
- Maximum durability
- Low maintenance
- Firm ride (minimal shock absorption)
- Best for indoor use on smooth surfaces

**vs. Other Caster Options:**
- **Solid (K0077):** Most durable, flat-free, minimal cushioning, indoor use
- **Semi-Pneumatic (K0072):** Balance of flat-free and moderate cushioning
- **Pneumatic (K0071):** Best shock absorption but requires maintenance

**Unit:** Each (one caster assembly). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters if both need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when solid tire casters meet patient's functional needs. Solid tire appropriate for indoor use, smooth terrain, and flat-free operation. SWO and proof of ownership required. RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Prior approval may be required if cost exceeds threshold *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document caster condition and justification for complete assembly replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of wheelchair ownership
- Wheelchair still meets coverage criteria
- Caster assembly damage or wear requiring replacement
- Functional justification for solid tire casters:
  - Indoor use primarily (smooth floors, limited terrain)
  - Flat-free operation needed (maintenance concerns, reliability)
  - Maximum durability required
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern and environment
- Why complete assembly vs. individual components (if applicable)
- SWO (Standard Written Order) before delivery
- RB modifier (replacement)
