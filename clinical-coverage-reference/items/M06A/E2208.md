# E2208 - Oxygen Cylinder Tank Carrier

## Clinical Overview

E2208 represents a cylinder tank carrier accessory for wheelchairs, designed to securely hold a portable oxygen tank during wheelchair use. This accessory is medically necessary for patients with respiratory or cardiac conditions requiring supplemental oxygen who use a wheelchair for mobility. The carrier allows safe transport of oxygen equipment, maintaining continuous oxygen therapy during wheelchair-based activities and community participation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Coverage is contingent upon the patient having already-approved portable oxygen equipment (E-codes for oxygen tanks, concentrators, or liquid oxygen systems). The carrier itself is not therapeutic but enables the patient to maintain prescribed oxygen therapy while mobile. Common conditions requiring oxygen during mobility include COPD, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** Patient must have documented approval for portable oxygen equipment BEFORE the wheelchair oxygen carrier can be covered. The carrier is an accessory to support oxygen therapy compliance, not a standalone item. Document continuous or ambulatory oxygen need. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Oxygen therapy:** Patient has Medicare-covered portable oxygen equipment (cylinder, concentrator, or liquid oxygen system) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Mobility oxygen need:** Patient requires supplemental oxygen during wheelchair use and mobility activities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
4. **Respiratory/cardiac diagnosis:** COPD, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, ILD, or other oxygen-qualifying condition *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document respiratory or cardiac diagnosis requiring supplemental oxygen
- Prescription for portable oxygen (already approved/covered)
- HCPCS codes for approved oxygen equipment (e.g., E0424, E0431, E0433)
- Oxygen flow rate and frequency (continuous, with exertion, PRN)
- Medical necessity for oxygen during wheelchair mobility activities
- Standard modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), or UE (used)

**Important Notes:**

- Oxygen equipment must be covered/approved FIRST before carrier is covered
- Document continuous or ambulatory oxygen prescription
- Carrier enables compliance with oxygen therapy during mobility
- Medicare LCD L33798 (Oxygen and Oxygen Equipment)
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - approved oxygen equipment prerequisite *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Respiratory/cardiac condition requiring oxygen therapy
- Wheelchair as primary mobility device
- Oxygen need during mobility

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document respiratory/cardiac diagnosis
- Approved portable oxygen prescription and HCPCS codes
- Oxygen flow rate and frequency
- Medical necessity for oxygen during wheelchair use
- Functional need to transport oxygen safely

**Important Notes:**

- Patient must have approved portable oxygen equipment
- Document continuous or ambulatory oxygen prescription
- Carrier supports oxygen therapy compliance during wheelchair mobility

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2208 - Wheelchair accessory, cylinder tank carrier, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis codes for respiratory/cardiac condition (COPD, respiratory failure, heart failure, ILD)
- [ ] Document patient uses wheelchair as primary mobility device
- [ ] Document patient has approved portable oxygen equipment
- [ ] Oxygen HCPCS codes (e.g., E0424, E0431, E0433, E0434)
- [ ] Oxygen flow rate and frequency (L/min, continuous vs. PRN)
- [ ] Medical necessity for oxygen during wheelchair mobility
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] NU modifier (new equipment) OR RR (rental) OR UE (used)
- [ ] Document oxygen equipment already approved/covered
- [ ] Continuous or ambulatory oxygen prescription
- [ ] Medical necessity for mobility oxygen

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] NU modifier (typically new for accessories)
- [ ] Approved oxygen equipment documented
- [ ] Oxygen therapy compliance during mobility

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Oxygen equipment not covered"** - No approved portable oxygen prescription. Fix: Patient must have Medicare/Medicaid-approved portable oxygen equipment BEFORE wheelchair oxygen carrier can be covered. Submit oxygen equipment prescription and approval first, then request carrier. Include oxygen HCPCS codes (E0424, E0431, E0433, etc.) in carrier prescription. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Oxygen not medically necessary during mobility"** - No documentation of oxygen need during wheelchair use. Fix: Document that patient requires continuous or ambulatory oxygen therapy, including during wheelchair mobility. Specify oxygen flow rate and frequency (e.g., "2 L/min continuous" or "3 L/min with exertion"). Explain oxygen need during community participation and wheelchair-based activities. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Respiratory diagnosis not documented"** - Missing qualifying diagnosis for oxygen therapy. Fix: Document specific respiratory or cardiac diagnosis qualifying patient for oxygen: COPD (J44.x), chronic respiratory failure (J96.1x), heart failure (I50.x), interstitial lung disease (J84.x), etc. Include oxygen saturation levels or arterial blood gas results supporting oxygen prescription. *(Under Review)*

4. **"Insufficient documentation of wheelchair dependency"** - Not clear patient uses wheelchair. Fix: Document wheelchair as patient's primary mobility device. Explain why patient requires wheelchair (e.g., severe dyspnea with exertion, limited endurance, cardiac limitations). Carrier only appropriate for wheelchair users, not ambulatory patients with portable oxygen. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No oxygen equipment HCPCS codes provided"** - Prescription doesn't reference approved oxygen equipment. Fix: Include specific HCPCS codes for patient's approved oxygen equipment (E0424 stationary concentrator, E0431 portable concentrator, E0433 portable gaseous cylinder, etc.). This proves oxygen equipment is already covered. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- **Document approved oxygen equipment FIRST** - include HCPCS codes (E0424, E0431, E0433) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify oxygen flow rate and frequency (e.g., 2 L/min continuous, 3 L/min with exertion) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document respiratory/cardiac diagnosis (COPD, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include oxygen saturation levels or ABG results if available *(Under Review)*
- Explain medical necessity: oxygen therapy during wheelchair mobility maintains compliance with oxygen prescription *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Use NU modifier for new carrier (most common for accessories) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document wheelchair dependency and mobility pattern *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- NU modifier typically used for accessories *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document approved portable oxygen equipment with HCPCS codes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify oxygen therapy prescription (flow rate, frequency) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain carrier enables oxygen therapy compliance during wheelchair-based community participation *(Under Review)*
- Document respiratory/cardiac condition requiring oxygen *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
