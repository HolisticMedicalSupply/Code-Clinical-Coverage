# E0951 - Heel Loop/Holder

## Clinical Overview

The E0951 heel loop/holder is a wheelchair accessory that secures the heel to the footrest, preventing heel migration and maintaining proper foot positioning. This device consists of a strap or holder that wraps around the heel, with or without an ankle strap component, to keep the foot positioned safely on the footrest throughout wheelchair use.

Heel loops are essential for patients with spasticity, contractures, or foot deformities who cannot maintain consistent heel contact with the footrest due to involuntary muscle movements, limited motor control, or structural foot abnormalities. Common conditions requiring heel positioning support include cerebral palsy (extensor spasticity pushing heel off footrest), spinal cord injury (lack of voluntary foot control), stroke with residual hemiplegia, and progressive neuromuscular conditions. Without heel loop support, patients risk heel slippage off the footrest, which can lead to foot injury from contact with wheels, improper sitting posture causing pressure ulcers, and difficulty with wheelchair propulsion. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL BILLING RESTRICTION:** Heel loops are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue and are NOT separately billable when provided with a new wheelchair. They are only separately billable as replacements after the initial wheelchair delivery. This billing restriction applies to both Medicare and Medicaid. Use RB (replacement) modifier when billing separately. Frequency limit: 2 replacements in 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. Document positioning need due to spasticity, contractures, or deformities. Document safety concerns regarding heel migration off footrest. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement with RB modifier.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. Document positioning need due to spasticity, contractures, or foot deformities. Document safety concerns. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - cerebral palsy (G80.x), spinal cord injury (G82.x), contractures (M24.5x), difficulty walking (R26.2)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting heel positioning need
- [ ] Specific condition causing heel migration: spasticity, contractures, or foot deformities
- [ ] Safety concerns: risk of heel slipping off footrest, potential for foot injury or posture problems
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] Document spasticity, contractures, or deformities preventing consistent heel contact with footrest
- [ ] **If billing as REPLACEMENT:** Use RB modifier (replacement of component); verify >2.5 years since last replacement (2 in 5 years limit)
- [ ] **If billing at initial wheelchair delivery:** Do NOT bill E0951 separately - included in wheelchair base

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] Document positioning need and safety concerns
- [ ] **If billing as REPLACEMENT:** Verify >2.5 years since last replacement (2 in 5 years limit)
- [ ] **If billing at initial wheelchair delivery:** Do NOT bill E0951 separately - included in wheelchair base

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial issue - included in wheelchair base"** - Most common error. E0951 is included in the wheelchair base at initial delivery and is NOT separately billable when provided with a new wheelchair. Fix: **Only bill E0951 as a REPLACEMENT after the initial wheelchair delivery.** Use RB (replacement of component) modifier when billing separately. Verify that wheelchair was previously delivered and heel loop is being replaced, not provided initially. At initial wheelchair setup, heel loops must be included in the wheelchair base code billing - they cannot be unbundled and billed separately. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No positioning need documented"** - Prescription requests heel loop but doesn't specify why heel positioning is medically necessary. Fix: **Document specific spasticity, contractures, or foot deformities requiring heel positioning.** Describe the medical condition causing heel migration: "Patient has extensor spasticity in lower extremities (G80.x cerebral palsy) causing involuntary heel extension off footrest; requires heel loop to maintain safe foot positioning" or "Patient with foot contractures (M24.5x) preventing consistent heel contact with footrest." Explain why the patient cannot maintain heel position without the device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No safety concerns documented"** - Prescription doesn't explain safety risks related to heel slipping off footrest. Fix: **Document specific safety risks:** heel slipping off footrest can cause foot injury from wheel contact, improper sitting posture leading to pressure ulcer risk, difficulty with wheelchair propulsion, or falls/transfers when foot is not properly positioned. Include safety justification: "Heel loop required to prevent foot slippage off footrest which presents injury risk and compromises sitting posture; patient unable to reposition foot independently due to [condition]." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Exceeded frequency limit"** - Requesting replacement before 2.5 years (frequency: 2 in 5 years). Fix: Verify timing - last E0951 provided more than 2.5 years ago. If requesting earlier replacement due to damage or wear, document specific medical necessity for early replacement: "Heel loop damaged due to daily use with severe spasticity causing excessive wear; replacement required for continued safe wheelchair use." *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Know the billing restriction:** Heel loops included in wheelchair base initially - only bill separately as replacements *(verified from source)*
- **Use RB modifier for replacements:** When billing separately, always use RB (replacement of component) modifier *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document specific condition:** Describe spasticity, contractures, or deformities causing heel migration - generic "needs heel loop" insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Include safety justification:** Explain risks if heel slips off footrest (injury, posture problems, wheelchair function) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify frequency compliance:** 2 in 5 years limit - ensure >2.5 years since last replacement *(verified from source)*
- **Match ICD-10 to condition:** Use appropriate codes - G80.x for CP with spasticity, G82.x for SCI, M24.5x for contractures *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same billing restriction as Medicare:** Included in wheelchair base initially, only bill separately as replacements *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order required:** Use NY Medicaid fiscal order format *(verified from source)*
- **Document positioning and safety:** Both are required - why heel positioning needed AND safety risks if not used *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify frequency limit:** 2 in 5 years - same as Medicare *(verified from source)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios for E0951:**
- Cerebral palsy with extensor spasticity pushing heels off footrests *(verified from source)*
- Spinal cord injury with lack of voluntary foot control *(verified from source)*
- Stroke with residual hemiplegia affecting foot positioning *(verified from source)*
- Progressive contractures preventing heel contact with footrest *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
