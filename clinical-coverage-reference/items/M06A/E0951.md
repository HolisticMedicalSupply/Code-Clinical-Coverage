# E0951 - Heel Loop/Holder

## Clinical Overview

Heel loop/holder for foot positioning due to spasticity, contractures, or deformities. Prevents heel migration off footrest. For CP, SCI, stroke patients requiring foot positioning and safety support.

**Included Initially:** Included in wheelchair base at initial issue - NOT separately billable when provided with new wheelchair.

**Replacement:** Separately billable as replacement only. Use RB modifier. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. Document positioning need due to spasticity, contractures, or deformities. Document safety concerns regarding heel migration off footrest. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement with RB modifier.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. Document positioning need due to spasticity, contractures, or foot deformities. Document safety concerns. Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

**NOT Separately Billable at Initial Issue:** Included in wheelchair base. Only bill separately as replacement.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial issue"** - Included in wheelchair base initially. NOT separately billable when provided with new wheelchair. Only bill as replacement after initial delivery.

2. **"No positioning need documented"** - Must document spasticity, contractures, or deformities requiring heel positioning to prevent migration off footrest.

3. **"No safety concerns documented"** - Document safety risks related to heel slipping off footrest due to positioning issues.
