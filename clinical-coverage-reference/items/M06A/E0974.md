# E0974 - Anti-Rollback Device

## Clinical Overview

Anti-rollback device for manual wheelchair to prevent backward rolling on slopes. For patients who self-propel on ramps/inclines.

**Covered If Self-Propels AND Needs Due to Ramps:** Must meet both criteria - patient self-propels wheelchair AND has ramps in home/community requiring anti-rollback device.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. Document: (1) Patient self-propels wheelchair, (2) Ramps/inclines present in home/community, (3) Specific ramp/incline description (location, degree of slope). Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Common Denials

1. **"Patient does not self-propel"** - Covered only if patient self-propels. Not covered for caregiver-propelled wheelchairs.
2. **"No ramps/inclines documented"** - Must document specific ramps in home/community requiring device. Describe location and slope.
