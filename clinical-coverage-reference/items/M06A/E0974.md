# E0974 - Anti-Rollback Device

## Clinical Overview

Anti-rollback device for manual wheelchair to prevent backward rolling on slopes. For patients who self-propel on ramps/inclines.

**Covered If Self-Propels AND Needs Due to Ramps:** Must meet BOTH criteria:
1. Patient self-propels wheelchair
2. Has ramps/inclines in home/community requiring anti-rollback device

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. **Both criteria must be met:**
1. **Patient self-propels wheelchair** - NOT covered for caregiver-propelled wheelchairs
2. **Ramps/inclines present in home/community** - Specific ramp/incline description required

Document:
- Patient self-propels wheelchair (not caregiver-propelled)
- Specific ramps in home/community: location, degree of slope
- Why anti-rollback device is medically necessary for safe ramp use

Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. **Both criteria must be met:**
1. **Patient self-propels wheelchair**
2. **Ramps/inclines in home/community**

Document:
- Patient self-propels wheelchair
- Specific ramp/incline description: location (entrance ramp, driveway, hallway), degree of slope
- Medical necessity for anti-rollback device

Frequency: 2 in 5 years.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient does not self-propel"** - Covered ONLY if patient self-propels wheelchair. NOT covered for caregiver-propelled wheelchairs (caregiver can control backward rolling).

2. **"No ramps/inclines documented"** - Must document specific ramps in home/community requiring device. Include location (entrance, driveway, hallway) and describe slope.

3. **"No specific ramp description"** - Generic statement "patient uses ramps" insufficient. Must describe specific location and degree of slope requiring anti-rollback protection.

4. **"Exceeded frequency limit"** - Limited to 2 in 5 years. Document medical necessity if requesting earlier replacement.
