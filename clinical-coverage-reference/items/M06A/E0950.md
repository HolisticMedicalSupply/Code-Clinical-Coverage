# E0950 - Wheelchair Tray

## Clinical Overview

Wheelchair tray providing stable surface for feeding, communication devices, ADLs, or medical equipment mounting. For patients with UE weakness/tremors or requiring ventilator/feeding equipment support.

**NOT Separately Payable at Initial Issue:** Cannot bill separately when included with new wheelchair.

**NY Medicaid:** Separately billable as replacement after initial issue.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. NOT separately payable if included at initial wheelchair issue. Describe functional need (feeding, communication device, ADLs). Beneficiary must have covered wheelchair.

### NY Medicaid: Written order required. NOT separately payable at initial issue. Separately billable as replacement. Describe functional need for tray.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial wheelchair issue"** - NOT separately payable if included with new wheelchair at initial issue. Only bill separately if added after initial delivery or as replacement.

2. **"No functional need documented"** - Must describe specific functional need: stable surface for feeding due to UE weakness/tremors, mounting surface for communication device, support for ventilator/feeding equipment.
