# K0072 - Front Caster Assembly, Complete, With Semi-Pneumatic Tire, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Complete front caster assembly replacement with semi-pneumatic (foam-filled) tire for beneficiary-owned manual wheelchair. Includes caster fork, wheel rim, semi-pneumatic tire, and bearings. Provides balance of flat-free operation with moderate shock absorption.

**Complete Caster Assembly:** Includes all caster components:
- Caster fork (E2226)
- Caster wheel rim (E2225)
- Semi-pneumatic caster tire (E2219 - foam-filled)
- Bearings and hardware

**Semi-Pneumatic Tire:** Foam-filled tire providing:
- Flat-free operation (no air, no punctures)
- Moderate shock absorption (less than pneumatic, more than solid)
- Balance of durability and comfort
- Lower maintenance than pneumatic

**vs. Other Caster Options:**
- **Pneumatic (K0071):** Best shock absorption but requires maintenance, can puncture
- **Semi-Pneumatic (K0072):** Balance of flat-free and cushioning
- **Solid (K0077):** Most durable, flat-free, minimal cushioning

**Unit:** Each (one caster assembly). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters if both need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when semi-pneumatic casters functionally justified. Document patient use pattern requires balance of flat-free benefit and shock absorption. SWO and proof of ownership required. RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Prior approval may be required if cost exceeds threshold *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Justify semi-pneumatic casters vs. pneumatic or solid options.

**Documentation Required:**
- Proof of wheelchair ownership
- Wheelchair still meets coverage criteria
- Caster assembly damage or wear requiring replacement
- Functional justification for semi-pneumatic casters:
  - Patient needs flat-free operation (maintenance concerns, puncture risk environment)
  - Patient also needs moderate shock absorption (some outdoor use, comfort)
  - Balance of durability and cushioning required
- Why semi-pneumatic vs. pneumatic (K0071) or solid (K0077):
  - Semi-pneumatic provides better durability than pneumatic with better comfort than solid
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern and environment
- SWO (Standard Written Order) before delivery
- RB modifier (replacement)
