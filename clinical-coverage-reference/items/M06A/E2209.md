# E2209 - Arm Trough

## Clinical Overview

Wheelchair arm trough with or without hand support. Provides positioning and support for upper extremities affected by quadriplegia, hemiplegia, or uncontrolled arm movements.

**Medicare LCD L33792 Criteria:** Must document quadriplegia, hemiplegia, OR uncontrolled arm movements (spasticity, involuntary movements).

**Functional Need:** Prevents arm from falling, provides positioning during MRADLs (mobility-related activities of daily living).

**Usage Requirement:** Patient must use wheelchair 2+ hours per day.

**Unit:** Each (one trough). Bill with LT/RT modifiers for laterality.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when patient has documented quadriplegia, hemiplegia, or uncontrolled movements AND uses wheelchair 2+ hours daily. PT/OT evaluation recommended to document functional need.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when patient requires upper extremity positioning support and cannot maintain arm position independently.

**Documentation Required:**
- Diagnosis: Quadriplegia, hemiplegia, or uncontrolled movements
- Wheelchair use: 2+ hours/day
- Functional assessment: Inability to maintain arm position, risk of arm falling
- Impact on MRADLs without arm support
- PT/OT evaluation documenting positioning needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- KA modifier (add-on accessory)
