# E2209 - Arm Trough

## Clinical Overview

E2209 represents an arm trough accessory for wheelchairs, with or without hand support, designed to provide upper extremity positioning and support for patients with quadriplegia, hemiplegia, or uncontrolled arm movements. The arm trough prevents the arm from falling off the wheelchair armrest, provides a stable resting surface for weakened or paralyzed limbs, and enables proper positioning during wheelchair-based mobility-related activities of daily living (MRADLs). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Medicare LCD L33792 specifically requires one of three qualifying conditions: quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs), hemiplegia (paralysis/weakness of one side), OR uncontrolled arm movements (spasticity, dystonia, chorea, athetosis, or other involuntary movements). The arm trough is medically necessary when the patient cannot independently maintain arm position on the armrest, creating risk of arm injury from falling or interfering with wheelchair propulsion and transfers. PT/OT evaluation is recommended to document functional limitations and positioning needs. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** Patient must use wheelchair at least 2 hours per day AND have documented quadriplegia, hemiplegia, OR uncontrolled arm movements per Medicare LCD L33792. PT/OT evaluation strongly recommended to document functional positioning needs and impact on MRADLs. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements - Per LCD L33792:**

1. **Qualifying diagnosis (ONE of the following):**
   - **Quadriplegia** (G82.50-G82.54): Paralysis of all four limbs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
   - **Hemiplegia** (G81.xx): Paralysis/weakness of one side of body *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
   - **Uncontrolled arm movements:** Spasticity, dystonia, chorea, athetosis, fasciculation, or other involuntary movements (G80.xx cerebral palsy, R25.2 cramp/spasm, R25.3 fasciculation) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Wheelchair usage:** Patient uses wheelchair at least 2 hours per day *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **Functional limitation:** Patient cannot independently maintain arm position on armrest; arm falls or interferes with function *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **Impact on MRADLs:** Arm positioning affects mobility-related activities of daily living (propulsion, transfers, reaching, positioning) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Specific diagnosis: Quadriplegia, hemiplegia, OR uncontrolled movements (ICD-10 code required)
- Document wheelchair use 2+ hours per day
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** documenting:
  - Inability to maintain arm position independently
  - Risk of arm falling from armrest
  - Functional limitations without arm support
  - Impact on MRADLs (propulsion, transfers, positioning)
- Medical necessity for arm positioning support
- **KA modifier** (add-on option/accessory)
- LT/RT modifier for laterality (left vs. right arm)

**Important Notes:**

- Medicare LCD L33792 (Manual Wheelchair Bases) specifies coverage criteria
- PT/OT evaluation strongly recommended for functional assessment
- Must document specific qualifying diagnosis - not sufficient to document general "weakness"
- 2-hour daily wheelchair use is minimum threshold
- Bill 1 unit with LT or RT modifier, or 2 units if bilateral arm troughs needed

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Upper extremity weakness, paralysis, or positioning needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Inability to maintain arm position independently
- Wheelchair use as primary mobility device
- Functional need for arm support during wheelchair use

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Upper extremity diagnosis (quadriplegia, hemiplegia, spasticity, weakness)
- Document inability to maintain arm position
- Functional assessment showing positioning needs
- PT/OT evaluation recommended
- Medical necessity for arm trough

**Important Notes:**

- NY Medicaid criteria similar to Medicare but may be slightly less restrictive
- Document upper extremity limitations and positioning needs
- Functional assessment showing risk of arm falling or injury

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2209 - Wheelchair accessory, arm trough, with or without hand support, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code: Quadriplegia (G82.5x), Hemiplegia (G81.xx), OR Uncontrolled movements (G80.xx, R25.2, R25.3)
- [ ] Document wheelchair use 2+ hours per day (Medicare requirement)
- [ ] LT or RT modifier for laterality (left arm vs. right arm)
- [ ] With or without hand support (specify if hand support included)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] KA modifier (add-on accessory)
- [ ] Document qualifying diagnosis per LCD L33792 (quadriplegia, hemiplegia, OR uncontrolled movements)
- [ ] Wheelchair use 2+ hours/day documented
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended - functional assessment of arm positioning needs
- [ ] Document inability to maintain arm position independently
- [ ] Impact on MRADLs without arm support

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] Upper extremity diagnosis documented
- [ ] Functional assessment showing positioning needs
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Qualifying diagnosis not documented"** - General weakness documented instead of specific qualifying condition. Fix: Must document specific qualifying diagnosis per Medicare LCD L33792: quadriplegia (G82.5x), hemiplegia (G81.xx), OR uncontrolled arm movements (G80.xx cerebral palsy, R25.2 spasm, R25.3 fasciculation). General "weakness" or "arthritis" does not qualify - must be paralysis or involuntary movements. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Wheelchair use less than 2 hours per day"** - Usage threshold not met. Fix: Document wheelchair use at least 2 hours per day. Include typical daily schedule showing wheelchair usage: e.g., "Patient uses wheelchair 4-6 hours daily for household mobility, transfers, and community activities." If usage is less than 2 hours/day, arm trough not medically necessary per LCD criteria. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Functional need not documented"** - No assessment of arm positioning limitations. Fix: Document specific functional limitations: "Patient cannot maintain right arm position on armrest due to hemiplegia. Arm falls off armrest during propulsion and transfers, creating safety risk and interfering with wheelchair control." Include PT/OT evaluation documenting positioning needs and impact on MRADLs. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"PT/OT evaluation not provided"** - Missing functional assessment. Fix: While PT/OT evaluation is "recommended" not "required," claims with professional therapy assessment have much higher approval rates. Request PT or OT to document: arm positioning limitations, risk of arm falling, functional impact on transfers/propulsion, and medical necessity for arm trough support. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"KA modifier missing"** - Billed without add-on modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use KA modifier when billing E2209 to indicate add-on option/accessory for wheelchair. Also use LT or RT modifier for laterality. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Patient can maintain arm position independently"** - Documentation shows patient has voluntary arm control. Fix: Arm trough only medically necessary if patient CANNOT maintain arm position independently due to paralysis or involuntary movements. If patient has voluntary control and can keep arm on armrest, arm trough is not medically necessary. *(Under Review)*
