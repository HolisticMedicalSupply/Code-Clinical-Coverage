# E0954 - Foot Box

## Clinical Overview

The E0954 foot box is a specialized wheelchair accessory that encloses and protects the foot/ankle while providing positioning support when standard footrests cannot be used. A foot box is a boxlike enclosure (rigid or semi-rigid) that attaches to the wheelchair in place of standard footrests, providing protection and positioning for feet/ankles that cannot be positioned safely on standard footrests due to severe contractures, significant edema, post-surgical needs, or other medical conditions requiring foot/ankle protection and elevated positioning.

Foot boxes are medically necessary for patients with severe foot/ankle contractures that prevent the foot from resting flat on standard footrests (fixed plantar flexion, dorsiflexion deformities), significant lymphedema or post-surgical edema requiring elevation and protection, post-surgical conditions requiring foot/ankle immobilization and protection during wheelchair use, or severe foot/ankle deformities that cannot be accommodated by standard footrest configurations. These conditions make standard footrests unsafe or impossible to use - the foot either cannot physically be positioned on the footrest due to contracture/deformity, or requires protection/elevation that standard footrests cannot provide. Without foot box accommodation, patients cannot use wheelchairs safely or may experience complications such as pressure ulcers, worsening edema, post-surgical complications, or inability to achieve proper sitting position. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL BILLING REQUIREMENT - UNIT = EACH PER FOOT:** E0954 is billed per foot, not per pair. Each foot requires a separate foot box and must be billed individually using LT (left) or RT (right) modifiers. For bilateral foot boxes (both feet), bill E0954 twice: once with LT modifier for left foot box, once with RT modifier for right foot box. This bilateral billing structure is critical for correct reimbursement. *(verified from source)*

**NY MEDICAID - PRIOR AUTHORIZATION MAY BE REQUIRED:** Unlike basic wheelchair accessories, foot boxes may require prior authorization for NY Medicaid coverage. Verify PA requirements before ordering. *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. Document:
- Inability to use standard footrests (due to contractures, edema, or post-surgical needs)
- Foot/ankle measurements showing foot box necessity
- Specific medical condition requiring foot box vs. standard footrests

Bill each foot separately with LT/RT modifiers.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. **PA may be required.** Document:
- Severe contractures, edema, or post-surgical condition preventing standard footrest use
- Foot/ankle measurements demonstrating need for foot box
- Why standard footrests cannot accommodate patient's foot positioning needs

Bill each foot separately with LT/RT modifiers.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - ankle/foot contractures (M24.56x), lymphedema (I89.0), spinal cord injury (G82.x), ankle/foot injury (S89.x)
- [ ] Medical necessity statement documenting inability to use standard footrests
- [ ] Specific condition: severe contractures, significant edema, post-surgical, or deformities preventing standard footrest use
- [ ] Foot/ankle measurements demonstrating need for foot box
- [ ] **Specify which foot:** left, right, or both
- [ ] **If bilateral:** Document need for foot boxes on BOTH feet
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] Document severe contractures, edema, or post-surgical condition preventing standard footrest use
- [ ] Provide foot/ankle measurements showing foot box necessity
- [ ] Explain why standard footrests cannot accommodate patient's foot positioning needs
- [ ] **Billing:** Use LT modifier for left foot box, RT modifier for right foot box
- [ ] **If bilateral:** Bill E0954 twice (once with LT, once with RT)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] **Verify if PA required** - NY Medicaid PA may be required for foot boxes
- [ ] **If PA required:** Obtain prior authorization before ordering
- [ ] Document same clinical criteria as Medicare (contractures, edema, post-surgical, measurements)
- [ ] **Billing:** Same LT/RT modifier requirements as Medicare

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Standard footrests would be adequate"** - Most common denial. Prescription requests foot box but doesn't adequately prove that standard footrests cannot be used due to patient's medical condition. Fix: **Document specific severe contractures, significant edema, or post-surgical needs that make standard footrests impossible or unsafe to use.** Be explicit: "Patient has fixed plantar flexion contracture of 45° preventing foot from resting flat on standard footrest; foot box required to accommodate contracture positioning and provide safe foot support during wheelchair use" or "Patient has severe lymphedema with foot/ankle circumference 18" requiring elevation and protection that standard footrests cannot provide." Demonstrate that standard footrests are truly inadequate, not just less comfortable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No measurements documented"** - Prescription lacks foot/ankle measurements showing why foot box is medically necessary vs. standard footrests. Fix: **Provide specific foot/ankle measurements** demonstrating medical necessity: ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion range (contracture degrees), foot/ankle circumference if edema, foot length/width if deformity. Example: "Ankle fixed in 40° plantar flexion, unable to achieve neutral position; foot cannot rest on standard footrest. Foot box required to accommodate fixed position" or "Lymphedema with ankle circumference 16" (normal 10"), foot width 6" (normal 4"); standard footrest inadequate for edematous foot positioning." Measurements prove medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No documentation of inability to use standard footrests"** - Prescription requests foot box but doesn't explicitly explain WHY patient cannot use standard footrests. Fix: **Explicitly document why patient cannot use standard footrests due to medical condition.** Explain the functional problem: "Patient cannot use standard footrests because: [1] severe contracture prevents foot from achieving flat position on footrest, [2] edema prevents foot from fitting between footrest and legrest, [3] post-surgical protection required that standard footrest cannot provide." Describe what happens when standard footrest attempted: "Attempted standard footrest; contracture causes heel to slip off, creating unsafe positioning." Make inability clear. *(verified from source - must document inability to use standard footrests)*

4. **"Billed incorrectly - bilateral billing error"** - Most common billing error for E0954. Foot boxes billed incorrectly: either (1) both feet billed as single unit without LT/RT modifiers, or (2) one line with quantity "2" instead of two separate lines with LT/RT modifiers. Fix: **Each foot must be billed separately with LT (left) or RT (right) modifier.** For bilateral foot boxes: Bill E0954 twice on separate lines - Line 1: E0954-LT (left foot box), Line 2: E0954-RT (right foot box). CANNOT bill as single unit for both feet. Each foot is a separate billable unit. If only one foot requires foot box, bill E0954 once with appropriate LT or RT modifier only. *(verified from source - unit = each per foot)*

5. **"No prior authorization"** (Medicaid) - NY Medicaid foot box ordered without prior authorization when PA required. Fix: **Verify NY Medicaid PA requirements before ordering.** Source indicates PA may be required for foot boxes (unlike basic wheelchair accessories). Contact NY Medicaid or check DVS system to confirm if PA needed. If required, submit and receive PA approval before ordering/delivering foot boxes. Include all documentation (measurements, inability to use standard footrests) with PA request. *(verified from source - NY Medicaid PA may be required)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document severe condition:** Contractures, edema, post-surgical must be SEVERE enough to prevent standard footrest use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Include measurements:** Ankle angles, circumferences, foot dimensions - specific numbers demonstrate medical necessity *(verified from source)*
- **Explain inadequacy of standard footrests:** Don't assume it's obvious - explicitly state why standard footrests cannot work *(verified from source)*
- **Use correct billing:** LT/RT modifiers for each foot; bill separately if bilateral *(verified from source)*
- **Match ICD-10 to condition:** M24.56x for ankle/foot contractures, I89.0 for lymphedema, S89.x for post-surgical *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Verify PA requirement FIRST:** Check if prior authorization required before ordering *(verified from source - PA may be required)*
- **If PA required, submit early:** Include all documentation with PA request (measurements, inability to use standard footrests) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Same clinical documentation as Medicare:** Severe condition, measurements, inadequacy of standard footrests *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Same billing structure:** LT/RT modifiers, bill separately if bilateral *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order format:** Use NY Medicaid fiscal order *(verified from source)*

**Common Clinical Scenarios for E0954:**
- Severe ankle contractures with fixed plantar flexion preventing standard footrest use *(verified from source)*
- Significant lymphedema requiring foot/ankle elevation and protection *(verified from source)*
- Post-surgical foot/ankle care requiring immobilization during wheelchair use *(verified from source)*
- Severe foot/ankle deformities that cannot be accommodated by standard footrest configurations *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Bilateral Billing Best Practices:**
- **For both feet:** Bill E0954 twice - once with LT, once with RT on separate claim lines *(verified from source)*
- **For one foot only:** Bill E0954 once with LT or RT only as appropriate *(Under Review)*
- **Document each foot separately:** If bilateral, document why EACH foot requires foot box (may have different conditions) *(Under Review)*
- **Never use quantity "2":** Don't bill E0954 x 2 - must use separate lines with modifiers *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
