# E0954 - Foot Box

## Clinical Overview

Foot box for foot/ankle protection and positioning. For severe contractures preventing standard footrest use, edema management, or post-surgical foot/ankle care.

**Unit = Each Per Foot:** Bill separately for each foot with LT/RT modifiers.

**NY Medicaid PA May Be Required.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

Written order required. Document:
- Inability to use standard footrests (due to contractures, edema, or post-surgical needs)
- Foot/ankle measurements showing foot box necessity
- Specific medical condition requiring foot box vs. standard footrests

Bill each foot separately with LT/RT modifiers.

### NY Medicaid (Nassau & Brooklyn)

Fiscal order required. **PA may be required.** Document:
- Severe contractures, edema, or post-surgical condition preventing standard footrest use
- Foot/ankle measurements demonstrating need for foot box
- Why standard footrests cannot accommodate patient's foot positioning needs

Bill each foot separately with LT/RT modifiers.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Standard footrests would be adequate"** - Must document severe contractures, significant edema, or post-surgical needs that prevent standard footrest use. Standard footrests must be proven inadequate.

2. **"No measurements documented"** - Foot/ankle measurements are required showing why foot box is medically necessary vs. standard footrests.

3. **"No documentation of inability to use standard footrests"** - Must explicitly document why patient cannot use standard footrests due to medical condition.

4. **"Billed incorrectly"** - Each foot must be billed separately with LT (left) or RT (right) modifier. Cannot bill as single unit for both feet.
