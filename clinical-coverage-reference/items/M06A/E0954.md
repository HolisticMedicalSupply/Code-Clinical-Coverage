# E0954 - Foot Box

## Clinical Overview

Foot box for foot/ankle protection/positioning. For severe contractures preventing standard footrest use, edema management, or post-surgical care.

**Unit = Each Per Foot:** Bill separately for each foot with LT/RT modifiers.

**NY Medicaid PA May Be Required.**

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Written order. Document inability to use standard footrests and measurements showing foot box necessity.

**Medicaid:** Fiscal order. PA may be required. Document contractures/edema/post-surgical needs preventing standard footrest use. Measurements required.

## Common Denials

1. **"Standard footrests would be adequate"** - Must document severe contractures/edema preventing standard footrest use.
2. **"No measurements documented"** - Foot/ankle measurements required showing need for foot box vs. standard footrests.
