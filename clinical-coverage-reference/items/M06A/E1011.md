# E1011 - Pediatric Width Adjustment Package

## Clinical Overview

The E1011 pediatric width adjustment package is a modification for pediatric-sized manual wheelchairs that adds width adjustability hardware allowing the wheelchair seat width to be expanded as the child grows. This modification includes mechanisms (adjustable hardware, sliding frame components, expandable seat rails) that enable wheelchair width to be adjusted incrementally to accommodate pediatric growth, avoiding the need for complete wheelchair replacement solely due to width changes as the child grows.

The width adjustment package is medically necessary for pediatric patients with growth potential requiring long-term wheelchair use who are anticipated to outgrow current wheelchair width due to normal childhood growth. Common pediatric conditions requiring width-adjustable wheelchairs include cerebral palsy requiring long-term wheelchair mobility through growth years, spina bifida with permanent wheelchair dependence during childhood development, muscular dystrophy with progressive course requiring wheelchair support through growth periods, and other congenital/developmental conditions necessitating wheelchair use during active growth phases. Width adjustment packages are cost-effective for growing children by allowing single wheelchair to accommodate growth through width adjustments rather than requiring multiple wheelchair replacements as child's body width increases. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL BILLING RESTRICTION - NOT TO BE DISPENSED WITH INITIAL CHAIR:** This is the single most important requirement for E1011. The HCPCS code description explicitly states "NOT TO BE DISPENSED WITH INITIAL CHAIR" - this means E1011 CANNOT be billed when the wheelchair is first delivered to the patient. E1011 is ONLY for adding width adjustment capability as a later modification after initial wheelchair delivery, OR when replacing a pediatric wheelchair where width adjustment not included in the new chair but is medically necessary for anticipated growth. Billing E1011 at initial wheelchair delivery will result in automatic denial. *(verified from source - cannot bill at initial delivery)*

**GROWTH POTENTIAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED:** Must document child's current measurements and anticipated growth trajectory necessitating width adjustment capability. *(verified from source)* **NY MEDICAID PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED.** *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. Document growth potential with: (1) Current measurements (chest width, shoulder width, hip width, current wheelchair seat width), (2) Anticipated growth trajectory based on age/developmental stage/growth charts, (3) Medical necessity for width adjustability to accommodate growth while avoiding premature wheelchair replacement. **Cannot bill at initial wheelchair delivery** - only as later modification.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. **Prior approval required before adding width adjustment package.** Document: (1) Pediatric patient with growth potential (age, developmental stage, expected growth), (2) Current measurements and anticipated measurements requiring width adjustment, (3) Justification for width adjustment capability versus standard fixed-width wheelchair. **Cannot bill at initial delivery** - only as modification after initial wheelchair dispensing.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

- [ ] **CRITICAL: Confirm NOT billing at initial wheelchair delivery**
- [ ] Pediatric patient with documented growth potential
- [ ] Current measurements: chest width, shoulder width, hip width, current wheelchair seat width
- [ ] Anticipated growth trajectory: age, developmental stage, expected growth based on growth charts
- [ ] Justification for width adjustment capability vs. fixed-width wheelchair
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

- [ ] Current and anticipated measurements documented
- [ ] Medical necessity for width adjustability to avoid premature replacement

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format

- [ ] **CANNOT bill at initial delivery** - same restriction as Medicare
- [ ] Growth documentation with measurements
- [ ] PA request must include: growth potential, current/anticipated measurements, medical necessity

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial wheelchair delivery - code restriction violated"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL. E1011 billed when wheelchair first dispensed to patient. Code description explicitly states "NOT TO BE DISPENSED WITH INITIAL CHAIR" - this is absolute restriction. Fix: **Only bill E1011 as later modification after wheelchair already delivered, OR with wheelchair replacement where width adjustment not included in new chair.** Timing scenarios for proper billing: (1) **Later modification:** Wheelchair previously delivered; child's growth now necessitates width adjustment capability; bill E1011 as modification to existing wheelchair. (2) **Wheelchair replacement:** Child receiving replacement wheelchair; width adjustment package medically necessary for new chair to accommodate continued growth; bill E1011 with replacement wheelchair (not "initial" chair for this code purpose). Document: "Patient received pediatric wheelchair [date]; child's growth now necessitates addition of width adjustment package to accommodate anticipated growth through childhood." NEVER bill E1011 at first wheelchair delivery. *(verified from source - explicit code restriction)*

2. **"No growth potential documented - pediatric justification inadequate"** - Request for width adjustment without documented anticipated growth requiring adjustability. Fix: **Document comprehensive growth potential showing need for width adjustability.** Include: (1) **Current age and growth stage:** "Patient age 6 years, actively growing, currently at 50th percentile for height/weight per pediatric growth charts." (2) **Current measurements:** "Current chest width 12", shoulder width 11", hip width 10"; current wheelchair seat width 12"." (3) **Anticipated growth:** "Expected to grow 2-3" in width measurements over next 2-3 years based on normal growth trajectory; will require wider seat to accommodate growth." (4) **Justification for adjustability:** "Width adjustment package allows wheelchair to expand from current 12" width to 16" width as child grows, avoiding need for complete wheelchair replacement solely due to width changes; cost-effective for growing child with long-term wheelchair needs." Growth documentation demonstrates medical necessity for adjustable vs. fixed-width wheelchair. *(verified from source - growth potential documentation required)*

3. **"No prior approval submitted" (NY Medicaid)** - Width adjustment package ordered without obtaining required Medicaid PA. Fix: **Obtain NY Medicaid prior approval BEFORE adding width adjustment package.** PA request must include: pediatric patient information (age, diagnosis, growth potential), current measurements and anticipated growth trajectory, medical necessity justification for width adjustability, documentation that NOT billing at initial delivery (later modification or replacement scenario). Submit complete PA documentation; await approval before proceeding with width adjustment package addition. Do not dispense modification before receiving PA approval. *(verified from source - Medicaid PA required)*

4. **"Patient not pediatric - adult patient"** - Width adjustment package requested for adult patient. E1011 specifically for "PEDIATRIC SIZE WHEELCHAIR" per code description. Fix: **Verify patient is pediatric with growth potential.** Code designed for children who will outgrow current wheelchair width due to childhood growth. Adult patients (growth complete) do not qualify for E1011 width adjustment package. If adult patient needs wider wheelchair, appropriate solution is wheelchair replacement with larger width, not width adjustment package. E1011 is pediatric-specific modification for growing children. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Fixed-width wheelchair adequate - adjustability not justified"** - Width adjustment requested without adequate justification why fixed-width wheelchair insufficient. Fix: **Justify why width adjustability medically necessary vs. fixed-width wheelchair or future replacement.** Explain: "Child age 5 with cerebral palsy (G80.x) requiring long-term wheelchair use through growth years; currently requires 12" seat width but anticipated to need 15-16" width by age 8-9 based on growth trajectory; width adjustment package allows single wheelchair to accommodate growth from age 5-10, avoiding multiple wheelchair replacements solely for width changes; cost-effective solution for growing child with permanent wheelchair needs." Cost-effectiveness and medical appropriateness of adjustable vs. fixed-width options. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **CRITICAL - Do NOT bill at initial delivery:** Most important requirement; violation = automatic denial *(verified from source - explicit restriction)*
- **Document growth potential comprehensively:** Age, measurements, growth trajectory, anticipated changes *(verified from source)*
- **Include current AND anticipated measurements:** Show width progression requiring adjustability *(verified from source)*
- **Justify adjustability vs. alternatives:** Explain why width adjustment better than fixed-width or future replacement *(Under Review)*
- **Cost-effectiveness angle:** Width adjustment avoids multiple wheelchair replacements as child grows *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**

- **Same "not at initial delivery" restriction as Medicare:** Cannot bill with first wheelchair *(verified from source)*
- **Comprehensive PA documentation:** Include all growth measurements and justification *(Under Review)*
- **Fiscal order:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*

**Proper Billing Scenarios:**
- **Later modification:** Add to existing wheelchair after initial delivery when growth necessitates *(Under Review)*
- **With replacement wheelchair:** When child receives new wheelchair and width adjustment needed *(Under Review)*
- **NOT proper:** At first wheelchair delivery to child - explicit violation *(verified from source)*
