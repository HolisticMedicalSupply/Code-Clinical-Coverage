# E1011 - Pediatric Width Adjustment Package

## Clinical Overview

Width adjustment package modification for pediatric wheelchairs to accommodate anticipated growth. For pediatric patients with growth potential requiring width adjustability to avoid premature wheelchair replacement.

**NOT at Initial Delivery:** CANNOT be billed when wheelchair first dispensed. Code explicitly states "NOT TO BE DISPENSED WITH INITIAL CHAIR." Only for modification/addition after initial delivery.

**Growth Potential Documentation Required:** Document current measurements and anticipated growth necessitating width adjustment capability.

**NY Medicaid Prior Approval Required.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. Document growth potential with: (1) Current measurements (chest width, shoulder width, hip width, current wheelchair seat width), (2) Anticipated growth trajectory based on age/developmental stage/growth charts, (3) Medical necessity for width adjustability to accommodate growth while avoiding premature wheelchair replacement. **Cannot bill at initial wheelchair delivery** - only as later modification.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. **Prior approval required before adding width adjustment package.** Document: (1) Pediatric patient with growth potential (age, developmental stage, expected growth), (2) Current measurements and anticipated measurements requiring width adjustment, (3) Justification for width adjustment capability versus standard fixed-width wheelchair. **Cannot bill at initial delivery** - only as modification after initial wheelchair dispensing.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial delivery"** - CANNOT bill when wheelchair first dispensed. Code explicitly states "NOT TO BE DISPENSED WITH INITIAL CHAIR." Only bill as later modification when growth makes width adjustability medically necessary.

2. **"No growth potential documented"** - Must document anticipated pediatric growth requiring width adjustability. Include: current age, expected growth trajectory, current measurements (chest, shoulder, hip width), anticipated measurements, justification for adjustment capability versus fixed-width chair or future replacement.

3. **"No prior approval"** (Medicaid) - NY Medicaid prior approval required before adding width adjustment package. Submit PA request with growth documentation, measurements, medical necessity justification before dispensing modification.

4. **"Patient not pediatric"** - Code specifically for pediatric size wheelchairs. Patient must be pediatric with growth potential. Adult patients do not qualify for width adjustment package under E1011.
