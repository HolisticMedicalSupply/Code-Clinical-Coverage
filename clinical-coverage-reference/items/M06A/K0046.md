# K0046 - Elevating Legrest, Lower Extension Tube, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement lower extension tube component for elevating legrest system. For component replacement when lower tube damaged/worn. Patient must continue to meet elevating legrest coverage criteria.

**Elevating Legrest System:** Patient must have covered elevating legrests (E0990 or K0195) and continue to meet one of three criteria:
1. Musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion, OR
2. Significant lower extremity edema requiring elevation, OR
3. Reclining back on wheelchair

**Component Replacement:** Lower extension tube only (not complete elevating legrest assembly). More economical when only this component damaged and rest of system functional.

**Replacement Only:** Included at initial elevating legrest issue. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Bundling:** K0046 bundled with K0195, E0990, E1010, E1012 at initial issue.

**Unit:** Each (one tube). Typically bill as pair (2 units) if both legrest tubes need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when patient continues to meet elevating legrest criteria and lower extension tube damaged. Document continued medical necessity for elevating legrests and component damage. RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Patient must continue to meet elevating legrest criteria. Document lower extension tube damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Patient continues to meet ONE of three elevating legrest criteria:
  - Musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion (measurements, cast/brace)
  - Significant LE edema requiring elevation (edema measurements)
  - Has reclining back wheelchair
- Lower extension tube damage/wear requiring replacement
- Justification why component replacement vs. complete legrest assembly
- RB modifier (replacement)
