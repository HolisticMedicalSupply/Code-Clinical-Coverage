# K0053 - Elevating Footrests, Articulating (Telescoping)

## Clinical Overview

Elevating footrests with articulating (telescoping) mechanism for manual or power wheelchair. Allows leg to be elevated for medical conditions preventing knee flexion, lower extremity edema, or use with reclining back wheelchairs.

**Articulating/Telescoping:** Footrest extends and articulates to accommodate leg elevation while maintaining proper support. Different from standard elevating legrests—articulating mechanism allows adjustment.

**Must Meet ONE of Three Criteria:**
1. Musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion; presence of cast/brace at knee, OR
2. Significant lower extremity edema requiring elevation, OR
3. Beneficiary has reclining back on wheelchair

**Same Criteria as E0990/K0195:** Coverage criteria identical to elevating leg rests (E0990 for purchased, K0195 for capped rental).

**Bundling:** K0053 bundled with E1009, E1010, E1012 at initial issue.

**Unit:** Each (one footrest). Billed per each side—typically bill as pair (2 units) for both legs.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when patient meets one of three criteria. Physician order and medical records documenting edema measurements/cast/brace/reclining back need required. PT/OT evaluation recommended for assessment and proper fitting.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when patient meets one of three criteria. Prior approval may be required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document specific criterion met and medical necessity.

**Documentation Required:**
- Must meet ONE of three criteria—document which one:
  - **Criterion 1:** Musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion; cast/brace present (ROM measurements, cast/brace prescription)
  - **Criterion 2:** Significant LE edema requiring elevation (edema measurements, circumferential measurements, photos)
  - **Criterion 3:** Has reclining back wheelchair (specify HCPCS code for reclining back)
- PT/OT evaluation recommended (positioning assessment, proper fitting)
- Why articulating/telescoping mechanism necessary vs. standard elevating legrests
- Billed per each with LT/RT as needed
