# E0981 - Seat Upholstery, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Seat upholstery replacement for wear/tear affecting function, infection control, or skin breakdown risk.

**REPLACEMENT ONLY:** NOT billable at initial wheelchair issue. Only for replacing worn/deteriorated upholstery.

**Medical Necessity, Not Cosmetic:** Must document functional deterioration or medical need (infection control, skin breakdown risk), not cosmetic preference.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. RB modifier (replacement). Evidence of deterioration required - document wear/tear affecting function or medical necessity (infection control, skin breakdown risk from deteriorated material). NOT cosmetic. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Common Denials

1. **"Billed at initial wheelchair issue"** - REPLACEMENT ONLY. Not billable with new wheelchair. Only for replacing worn upholstery.
2. **"Cosmetic replacement"** - Must be medical necessity (functional deterioration, infection control, skin breakdown risk), not cosmetic preference.
3. **"No evidence of deterioration"** - Document wear/tear with photos/description showing functional compromise or medical risk.
