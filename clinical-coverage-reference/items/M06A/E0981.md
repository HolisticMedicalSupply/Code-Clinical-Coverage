# E0981 - Seat Upholstery, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Seat upholstery replacement for wear/tear affecting function, infection control, or skin breakdown risk. **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code - NOT billable at initial wheelchair issue.

**Medical Necessity, Not Cosmetic:** Must document functional deterioration or medical need (infection control, skin breakdown risk from deteriorated material), not cosmetic preference or appearance concerns.

**Evidence of Deterioration Required:** Document wear/tear with photos or detailed description showing functional compromise.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. **RB modifier** (replacement of part). Evidence of deterioration required - document wear/tear affecting function or medical necessity (infection control, skin breakdown risk from deteriorated material). NOT for cosmetic replacement. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Replacement only. Evidence of wear/tear affecting seating function required. Medical necessity (functional deterioration, infection control, pressure ulcer risk), not cosmetic preference. Frequency: 1 in 12 months.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial wheelchair issue"** - REPLACEMENT ONLY code. Cannot be billed when new wheelchair first dispensed. Only for replacing worn upholstery on beneficiary-owned wheelchair.

2. **"Cosmetic replacement"** - Must be medical necessity. Document functional deterioration (tears compromising seating support, soiling creating infection control concern, material breakdown threatening skin integrity), not cosmetic appearance preference.

3. **"No evidence of deterioration"** - Document wear/tear with photo documentation or detailed written description showing functional compromise or medical risk. Describe specific areas of wear, tears, material breakdown affecting function or creating medical concern.
