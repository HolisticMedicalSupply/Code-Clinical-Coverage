# E2211 - Pneumatic Propulsion Tire, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement pneumatic (air-filled) propulsion tire for rear wheels of manual wheelchair. Provides cushioned ride for outdoor use and uneven terrain. Requires inner tube (E2212).

**Pneumatic vs. Solid/Foam:** Pneumatic tires offer shock absorption and comfort but require maintenance (inflation, puncture repair). Compare to foam-filled (E2216) or solid tires.

**Replacement Only:** Tires included in wheelchair base at initial issue. Separately billable only as replacement due to wear or damage.

**Unit:** Each (one tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both rear wheels.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when tires worn or damaged. Pneumatic tires appropriate for patients requiring shock absorption for comfort or outdoor use.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document tire wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Tire wear or damage requiring replacement
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern (indoor/outdoor, terrain)
- RB modifier (replacement)
- Note: E2212 (tube) billed separately if needed
