# K0017 - Detachable, Adjustable Height Armrest Base, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Adjustable height armrest base for manual or power wheelchair. Allows arm height adjustment to accommodate patient anatomy and functional positioning needs. For patients requiring non-standard arm height.

**Adjustable Height:** Armrest height can be adjusted to fit patient's anatomy (compare to K0015 fixed-height armrests). Critical for proper positioning and function.

**Medicare Coverage Criteria:**
- Requires different arm height (patient measurements outside standard range) AND
- Spends ≥2 hours/day in wheelchair

**Bundling:** K0017 base bundled with:
- E0973 (wheelchair component/accessory)
- K0018 (upper armrest portion)
- K0019 (arm pad)

**Unit:** Each (one armrest base). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both armrests.

## Coverage

**Medicare LCD:** Covered when patient requires different arm height than standard AND uses wheelchair 2+ hours daily. Document specific arm height requirements, hours of daily use, functional need for height adjustment.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when adjustable height medically necessary. Prior approval may be required for power wheelchairs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document patient measurements showing standard height inadequate.

**Documentation Required:**
- Patient measurements (arm length, torso height, shoulder-to-elbow dimensions)
- Why standard non-adjustable armrests inadequate
- Wheelchair use: 2+ hours/day
- Functional needs requiring specific arm height (transfers, propulsion, positioning, pressure relief)
- Trial with standard armrests showing inadequacy (if applicable)
- RB modifier (replacement)
