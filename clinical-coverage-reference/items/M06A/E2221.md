# E2221 - Solid Caster Tire (Removable)

## Clinical Overview

Solid rubber or plastic caster tire (removable from wheel) for front wheels of manual wheelchair. Hard construction for maximum durability. Maintenance-free, flat-free option.

**Removable:** Tire is separate component that can be removed from caster wheel (compare to E2222 where tire and wheel are integrated).

**Solid Construction:** Hard rubber or plastic (no air, no foam). Firmest ride but most durable.

**Caster Location:** Front wheels (typically smaller than rear propulsion wheels).

**Replacement Only:** Caster tires included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one caster tire). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when caster tires worn or damaged. Solid construction appropriate for maximum durability and maintenance-free needs.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document tire wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Caster tire wear or damage
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern
- RB modifier (replacement)
