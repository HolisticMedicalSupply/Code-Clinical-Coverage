# E2206 - Wheel Lock Assembly, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

E2206 represents a replacement wheel lock assembly (also called wheel brakes) for manual wheelchairs. Wheel locks are critical safety components that prevent the wheelchair from rolling during transfers, while stationary, or when parked. Standard wheel locks are included in the wheelchair base code at initial issue; E2206 is used only when replacing worn/broken locks or upgrading to a different lock type due to medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

There are several types of wheel locks: scissors locks (pull to lock), push-handle locks (push down to lock), toggle locks, and high-mount locks for patients with limited reach. Patients with arthritis, limited grip strength, or difficulty reaching standard locks may require an upgraded lock type for safe independent wheelchair use. Wheel lock failure poses serious safety risks during transfers and can lead to falls. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Standard wheel locks are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue. E2206 is only separately billable when replacing broken/worn locks or upgrading to a different lock type with documented medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Safety need:** Functional wheel locks essential for transfer safety and fall prevention *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Replacement justification:** Original locks worn/broken OR inadequate for patient's functional abilities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
4. **Upgrade justification (if applicable):** Different lock type medically necessary due to upper extremity limitations, limited reach, or safety concerns *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document reason for replacement (wear/damage OR functional inadequacy)
- If upgrading lock type: Document why standard lock type inadequate for patient's abilities
- Justify specific lock type needed (e.g., high-mount for limited reach, push-handle for arthritis)
- Document transfer safety concerns requiring functional locks
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both wheels

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue (included in base code)
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- Wheel lock failure creates fall risk during transfers - document safety concerns
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document upper extremity limitations if upgrading lock type
- Transfer safety assessment

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Reason for replacement (wear/damage/functional inadequacy)
- If upgrading: Medical necessity for specific lock type
- Document safety risks with inadequate locks
- RB modifier for replacement billing

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only - not billable at initial wheelchair issue
- Specify lock type if different from standard (e.g., high-mount, push-handle)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2206 - Manual wheelchair accessory, wheel lock assembly, replacement, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency OR upper extremity limitation if upgrading)
- [ ] Quantity: Typically 2 (pair of locks for both wheels)
- [ ] Reason for replacement: Worn/broken OR functionally inadequate
- [ ] If upgrading: Specify lock type needed (scissors, push-handle, high-mount, toggle)
- [ ] Document why upgrade medically necessary (arthritis, limited reach, safety)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime OR justify early replacement
- [ ] Transfer safety assessment if locks inadequate
- [ ] Upper extremity functional assessment if upgrading lock type

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Specify lock type if different from standard
- [ ] Document safety risks with inadequate/broken locks

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue. Fix: E2206 is REPLACEMENT ONLY. Only bill when replacing worn/broken locks on existing wheelchair, not at initial wheelchair issue. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient documentation of medical necessity"** - No justification for replacement or upgrade. Fix: Document specific reason for replacement (locks broken/worn with safety risk OR inadequate for patient's functional abilities). If upgrading lock type, document upper extremity limitations (arthritis, weakness, limited reach) and why standard lock type inadequate for safe use. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Transfer safety not documented"** - Missing assessment of fall risk with inadequate locks. Fix: Document that functional wheel locks are essential for safe transfers. Explain how broken/inadequate locks create fall risk during transfers to/from wheelchair. Include transfer assessment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Upgrade not medically justified"** - Upgrading to different lock type without clear medical need. Fix: If replacing with different lock type (e.g., standard scissors lock to high-mount or push-handle), document specific medical reason: arthritis preventing grip of standard lock, limited reach requiring high-mount, weakness preventing operation of scissors lock, etc. *(Under Review)*

5. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2206 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Always use **RB modifier** to indicate replacement part *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bill 2 units (pair) if replacing locks on both wheels *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document clear safety concern: broken locks create fall risk during transfers *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If upgrading lock type, specify exact type needed and medical justification *(Under Review)*
- Document upper extremity limitations requiring different lock type (arthritis, limited reach, weakness) *(Under Review)*
- Include transfer safety assessment showing need for functional locks *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Ensure replacement is within wheelchair's 5-year reasonable useful lifetime *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document safety risks clearly - locks essential for transfer safety *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If upgrading, specify lock type and justify medical necessity *(Under Review)*
- Document reason for replacement (wear/damage/safety concern) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
