# E2205 - Handrim Without Projections, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

E2205 represents a replacement handrim without projections for manual wheelchairs. Handrims are the circular gripping surfaces attached to the rear wheels that wheelchair users grasp to propel themselves. This code covers replacement of standard smooth handrims when the original component has worn out or been damaged, or when an upgraded handrim is medically necessary due to the patient's upper extremity limitations. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Patients with arthritis, joint pain, generalized weakness, or hemiplegia may have difficulty gripping standard smooth handrims effectively. While this code covers standard handrims WITHOUT projections (smooth surface), it may be appropriate when replacing damaged handrims or when the patient's condition has changed since initial wheelchair issue. For patients requiring enhanced grip, consider E2205 with textured coating or E2206 (which typically refers to wheel locks - verify if handrim with projections uses different code). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Standard handrims are included in the wheelchair base code at initial issue and cannot be billed separately. E2205 is only separately billable when replacing worn/damaged handrims or upgrading from standard handrims due to documented medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Replacement need:** Original handrims worn, damaged, or inadequate for patient's current functional status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Upper extremity limitations (if upgrading):** Arthritis, weakness, limited grip strength, or pain preventing effective use of standard handrims *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document reason for replacement (wear/damage OR functional inadequacy)
- If upgrading from standard: Document upper extremity diagnosis and functional limitations
- Justify why standard handrims inadequate for patient's propulsion needs
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)
- LT/RT modifier if replacing single side only

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue (included in base code)
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- If replacing before reasonable wear timeline, document reason (e.g., premature failure, change in patient condition)
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document upper extremity limitations if upgrading from standard

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Reason for replacement (wear/damage/functional need)
- **Invoice cost documentation may be required** to verify pricing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier for replacement billing

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only - not billable at initial wheelchair issue
- NY Medicaid may request invoice to verify replacement cost is reasonable

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2205 - Manual wheelchair accessory, handrim, replacement, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code for upper extremity limitation (if applicable) or wheelchair dependency
- [ ] Quantity: Specify 1 or 2 (one handrim vs. pair)
- [ ] Reason for replacement: Worn/damaged OR functional inadequacy
- [ ] If upgrading: Document why standard handrims inadequate
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] LT or RT modifier if replacing single side
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime OR justify early replacement
- [ ] Upper extremity functional assessment if upgrading

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Invoice cost may be requested - ensure pricing is reasonable

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue instead of as replacement. Fix: E2205 is REPLACEMENT ONLY. Only bill when replacing worn/damaged handrims on existing wheelchair, not at initial wheelchair issue. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient documentation of medical necessity"** - No justification for replacement or upgrade. Fix: Document reason for replacement (wear/damage with timeframe since last replacement OR change in patient's functional status requiring upgrade). If upgrading from standard, document upper extremity diagnosis and functional limitations preventing effective use of standard handrims. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Replaced before reasonable useful lifetime"** - Handrim replaced too soon after previous replacement. Fix: Handrims typically last several years under normal use. If replacing earlier, document reason: premature wear due to heavy use, damage from accident/incident, or change in patient condition requiring different handrim type. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2205 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Wheelchair not covered/expired"** - Base wheelchair not approved or outside reasonable useful lifetime. Fix: Verify base wheelchair is covered and within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime for Medicare. Replacement parts generally not covered if wheelchair itself is no longer covered. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Always use **RB modifier** to indicate replacement part *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document clear reason for replacement: wear/damage OR functional inadequacy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If replacing both handrims, bill 2 units of E2205 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If replacing single side, bill 1 unit with LT or RT modifier *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If upgrading from standard: Document upper extremity diagnosis (arthritis, weakness) and functional limitations with standard handrims *(Under Review)*
- Ensure replacement is within wheelchair's 5-year reasonable useful lifetime OR document justification for early replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Keep records of wheelchair issue date and previous handrim replacements *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Be prepared to provide invoice cost documentation if requested *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document reason for replacement clearly (wear/damage/functional need) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Ensure pricing is reasonable and competitive *(Under Review)*
