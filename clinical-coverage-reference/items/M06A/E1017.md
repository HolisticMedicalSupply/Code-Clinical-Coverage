# E1017 - Heavy Duty Shock Absorber

## Clinical Overview

Heavy duty shock absorber for heavy/extra heavy duty manual wheelchairs. Same indications as E1015 PLUS patient weight >250 lbs (heavy duty) or >300 lbs (extra heavy duty).

**Same as E1015 PLUS Weight:** All E1015 requirements plus patient weight and wheelchair capacity documentation.

**Must Have Heavy/Extra Heavy Duty Base:** Patient must have K0006 (>250 lbs) or K0007 (>300 lbs) wheelchair.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. Same requirements as E1015 (terrain, medical condition, jarring impact) PLUS: (1) Patient weight >250 lbs (K0006) or >300 lbs (K0007), (2) Wheelchair weight capacity documentation, (3) Document patient has heavy/extra heavy duty wheelchair base. PA may be required.

## Common Denials

1. **"Patient weight ≤250 lbs - E1015 appropriate"** - Use E1015 for patients ≤250 lbs. E1017 only for >250 lbs with heavy/extra heavy duty base.
2. **"No heavy duty wheelchair documented"** - Must have K0006 or K0007 heavy/extra heavy duty wheelchair base.
3. **"Same as E1015 denials"** - Plus weight/medical necessity/terrain documentation.
