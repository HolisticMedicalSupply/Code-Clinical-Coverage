# E1017 - Heavy Duty Shock Absorber

## Clinical Overview

The E1017 heavy duty shock absorber is a reinforced wheelchair accessory for bariatric manual wheelchairs that provides the same vibration dampening and jarring reduction as E1015 standard shock absorbers, but with enhanced weight capacity to accommodate patients weighing >250 lbs (heavy duty) or >300 lbs (extra heavy duty). This device uses heavy duty springs or hydraulic components designed to handle the increased forces and stresses associated with higher patient weights during wheelchair mobility over rough terrain.

Heavy duty shock absorbers are medically necessary for bariatric patients who meet ALL E1015 criteria (regular rough terrain use AND medical condition exacerbated by jarring - osteoporosis, spinal pain, pressure ulcers) PLUS have patient weight exceeding standard wheelchair capacity (>250 lbs requiring heavy duty K0006 wheelchair, or >300 lbs requiring extra heavy duty K0007 wheelchair). Standard shock absorbers (E1015) are not designed for the forces generated by heavier patient weights and would fail or provide inadequate shock absorption. Heavy duty design ensures safe, effective vibration dampening for bariatric wheelchair users with the same medical conditions requiring shock absorption. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ALL E1015 REQUIREMENTS PLUS WEIGHT:** Patient must meet all three E1015 documentation requirements (terrain, medical condition, jarring impact) PLUS documented patient weight >250 lbs and heavy/extra heavy duty wheelchair. *(verified from source)* **PA may be required** for both Medicare and Medicaid. *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. ALL E1015 requirements (terrain description, medical condition, jarring impact) PLUS: (1) Patient weight documented - >250 lbs for heavy duty or >300 lbs for extra heavy duty, (2) Wheelchair weight capacity - must have K0006 (heavy duty) or K0007 (extra heavy duty) wheelchair, (3) Justification for heavy duty vs. standard E1015. PA may be required. *(verified from source)*

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Same as Medicare - all E1015 requirements plus weight and wheelchair capacity documentation. PA may be required. *(verified from source)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements (ALL E1015 PLUS):**
- [ ] All E1015 requirements: terrain description, medical condition, jarring impact
- [ ] **Patient weight documented** - >250 lbs (heavy duty) or >300 lbs (extra heavy duty)
- [ ] **Wheelchair capacity documented** - K0006 or K0007 heavy/extra heavy duty wheelchair
- [ ] ICD-10 for obesity/BMI if applicable - E66.x, Z68.4x
- [ ] ICD-10 for medical condition: M80-M81, M54.x, L89.x, Z99.3
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] All E1015 documentation requirements
- [ ] Patient weight >250 lbs (K0006) or >300 lbs (K0007)
- [ ] Document patient has heavy/extra heavy duty wheelchair base
- [ ] Verify if PA required

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] Same as Medicare requirements
- [ ] Verify if PA required before ordering

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient weight ≤250 lbs - E1015 appropriate"** - MOST COMMON DENIAL for E1017. Patient weight documented as ≤250 lbs making E1017 heavy duty shock absorber unnecessary. Fix: **E1017 ONLY for patients >250 lbs.** For patients ≤250 lbs with standard wheelchairs, use E1015 standard shock absorber. Document patient weight clearly: "Patient weight 275 lbs; uses K0006 heavy duty wheelchair; requires E1017 heavy duty shock absorber to accommodate weight and forces during rough terrain use." If weight ≤250 lbs, bill E1015, not E1017. Weight threshold is critical criterion for E1017 vs. E1015. *(verified from source - must be >250 lbs)*

2. **"No heavy/extra heavy duty wheelchair documented"** - E1017 requested but patient doesn't have heavy duty wheelchair base. Standard wheelchair with heavy duty shock absorber is inappropriate and unsafe. Fix: **Patient must have K0006 (heavy duty >250 lbs) or K0007 (extra heavy duty >300 lbs) wheelchair.** Document wheelchair type: "Patient has K0006 heavy duty wheelchair (weight capacity 250-300 lbs); patient weight 275 lbs; E1017 heavy duty shock absorber required to match wheelchair weight capacity and provide adequate shock absorption for patient's weight." Standard wheelchair users cannot use E1017 heavy duty shocks - must have bariatric wheelchair base. *(verified from source - must have heavy duty base)*

3. **"All E1015 denial reasons apply to E1017"** - E1017 has all E1015 requirements (terrain, medical condition, jarring impact) plus weight/wheelchair requirements. Common denials include: no medical necessity (comfort only), no terrain description, jarring impact not explained, medical condition not documented. Fix: **Document all E1015 requirements** thoroughly PLUS weight and wheelchair capacity. Example: "Patient weight 285 lbs with K0006 heavy duty wheelchair; has osteoporosis (M80.x); requires daily wheelchair mobility over gravel driveway and cracked sidewalks accessing home; jarring impacts increase fracture risk; E1017 heavy duty shock absorber medically necessary to minimize impact forces given patient weight and osteoporosis." All E1015 criteria must be met. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Weight documented but inadequate for heavy duty"** - Weight listed but doesn't meet >250 lb threshold. Patient at 245 lbs doesn't qualify for E1017. Fix: Verify patient weight accurately. If truly >250 lbs, document current weight with date measured. If patient lost weight to ≤250 lbs, E1015 may be appropriate instead of E1017. Weight must genuinely exceed 250 lbs for heavy duty designation. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **ALL E1015 criteria apply:** Terrain description, medical condition, jarring impact - must document all three *(verified from source)*
- **PLUS weight >250 lbs:** Document patient weight clearly *(verified from source)*
- **PLUS heavy duty wheelchair:** K0006 or K0007 required - document wheelchair code *(verified from source)*
- **PA may be required:** Verify before ordering *(verified from source)*
- **Justify heavy duty vs. standard:** Explain why E1017 necessary vs. E1015 (weight exceeds standard capacity) *(verified from source)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same as Medicare:** All E1015 plus weight plus wheelchair capacity *(verified from source)*
- **PA may be required:** Check before ordering *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order format:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*

**Weight Thresholds:**
- **Heavy duty (K0006):** Patient weight >250-300 lbs *(verified from source)*
- **Extra heavy duty (K0007):** Patient weight >300 lbs *(verified from source)*
- **Standard (K0001-K0005):** Patient weight ≤250 lbs - use E1015, not E1017 *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E1015** - Standard Shock Absorber - For patients ≤250 lbs; same medical criteria but standard weight capacity
- **K0006** - Heavy Duty Wheelchair - Required wheelchair base for E1017 (>250 lbs capacity)
- **K0007** - Extra Heavy Duty Wheelchair - Required for patients >300 lbs using E1017
- **E66.x** - Obesity - ICD-10 code often applicable for bariatric patients
- **Z68.4x** - BMI ≥40 and above - Body mass index codes for documentation
