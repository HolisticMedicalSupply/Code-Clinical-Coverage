# K0052 - Swingaway, Detachable Footrests, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement swingaway, detachable footrests for beneficiary-owned manual wheelchair. Swingaway footrests pivot out of the way for transfers. For replacement when footrests worn or damaged beyond repair.

**Swingaway Function:** Footrests swing away (pivot sideways) to clear path for transfers, then swing back into position for use. Essential for safe transfers.

**Detachable:** Footrests can be completely removed from wheelchair if needed.

**Replacement Only:** Footrests included in manual wheelchair base at initial issue. NOT separately billable at initial issue. Only billable as replacement.

**Wheelchair Must Be Covered:** Replacement only covered when beneficiary owns manual wheelchair that met coverage criteria (mobility limitation impairing MRADLs).

**Unit:** Each (one footrest). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both footrests.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement for beneficiary-owned manual wheelchair meeting coverage criteria. Standard Written Order (SWO) required before delivery. Medical records must support wheelchair medical necessity. RB modifier for replacement.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document footrest damage or wear requiring replacement and that wheelchair still meets coverage criteria.

**Documentation Required:**
- Wheelchair coverage criteria met (mobility limitation impairing MRADLs)
- Footrest damage or wear beyond repair
- Why replacement necessary vs. repair
- Medical necessity for wheelchair continues
- SWO (Standard Written Order) before delivery
- RB modifier (replacement)
