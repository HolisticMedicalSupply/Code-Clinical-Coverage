# E2207 - Crutch and Cane Holder

## Clinical Overview

E2207 represents a crutch and cane holder accessory for wheelchairs, designed to secure assistive walking devices to the wheelchair frame. This accessory is appropriate for partial ambulators who use a wheelchair as their primary mobility device for longer distances but also require canes or crutches for short-distance ambulation, standing transfers, or household mobility. The holder allows patients to safely transport their walking aids without dropping them or leaving them behind. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Typical users include patients with progressive conditions (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's), hemiplegia patients who use a cane for ambulation but wheelchair for longer distances, or patients with arthritis who use a wheelchair outdoors but walk short distances indoors with cane support. The key coverage criterion is documented use of BOTH wheelchair AND walking aids - patients who use only a wheelchair or only walking aids would not qualify. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** Patient must have documented dual mobility needs - using both wheelchair for primary mobility AND cane/crutches for ambulation or transfers. This is not appropriate for patients who use only a wheelchair or only walking aids. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Dual mobility:** Patient uses both wheelchair (primary mobility) AND cane/crutches (for ambulation/transfers) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Functional need:** Patient requires safe transport of walking aids during wheelchair use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Partial ambulation status:** Patient ambulates for short distances or transfers with walking aids but uses wheelchair for primary mobility *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document patient uses wheelchair as primary mobility device
- Document patient also uses cane/crutches for short-distance ambulation or transfers
- Specify type of walking aid (standard cane, quad cane, axillary crutch, forearm crutch)
- Functional justification: Need to transport walking aids safely during wheelchair use
- Standard modifiers: NU (new), RR (rental), or UE (used)

**Important Notes:**

- Patient must use BOTH wheelchair and walking aids to qualify
- Not covered if patient uses only wheelchair without walking aids
- Not covered if patient is fully ambulatory with only walking aids
- Document specific scenarios where patient uses each mobility device
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - dual mobility requirement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document both wheelchair use and walking aid use
- Partial ambulation status

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document wheelchair as primary mobility device
- Document walking aid use for ambulation/transfers
- Specify walking aid type (cane, quad cane, crutches)
- Functional need to transport aids safely

**Important Notes:**

- Must demonstrate use of both mobility methods
- Document typical daily scenarios for each device (e.g., wheelchair for community mobility, cane for transfers)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2207 - Wheelchair accessory, crutch and cane holder, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis codes for both mobility impairment and ambulation need
- [ ] Document patient uses wheelchair as primary mobility device
- [ ] Document patient uses cane/crutches for short-distance ambulation or transfers
- [ ] Specify walking aid type (standard cane, quad cane, axillary crutch, forearm crutch)
- [ ] Functional need to safely transport walking aids
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] NU modifier (new equipment) OR RR (rental) OR UE (used)
- [ ] Document specific scenarios for wheelchair use vs. walking aid use
- [ ] Partial ambulation status assessment

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] NU modifier (typically new for accessories)
- [ ] Document dual mobility pattern clearly

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient does not use both wheelchair and walking aids"** - Only wheelchair use documented OR only walking aid use documented. Fix: Must document patient uses BOTH wheelchair (primary mobility for longer distances) AND cane/crutches (for short-distance ambulation or transfers). Include specific scenarios: e.g., "Patient uses wheelchair for community mobility and shopping but uses quad cane for household ambulation and transfers." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient documentation of dual mobility need"** - No clear explanation of when patient uses each device. Fix: Document typical daily pattern: when patient uses wheelchair vs. when patient uses walking aids. Example: "Wheelchair for distances >50 feet and outdoor mobility; quad cane for indoor household ambulation and toilet transfers." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Walking aid not specified"** - Prescription doesn't identify type of walking aid. Fix: Specify exact walking aid type being transported: standard cane, quad cane, axillary crutches, forearm crutches, etc. This helps justify medical necessity and ensures proper holder selection. *(Under Review)*

4. **"Patient fully ambulatory with walking aids"** - Patient doesn't require wheelchair. Fix: E2207 is only appropriate for patients who use wheelchair as PRIMARY mobility device. Document why wheelchair is medically necessary for longer distances/community mobility despite patient's ability to ambulate short distances with walking aids. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Patient uses wheelchair exclusively"** - No walking aid use documented. Fix: Document scenarios where patient uses cane/crutches (e.g., transfers, short household distances, standing activities). If patient truly doesn't use walking aids, E2207 is not appropriate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Clearly document **BOTH** mobility methods: wheelchair use AND walking aid use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify scenarios for each: e.g., wheelchair for community/longer distances, cane for transfers/household *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Identify exact walking aid type (standard cane, quad cane, crutches) *(Under Review)*
- Include functional assessment showing partial ambulation status *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document safety need: prevents dropping/losing walking aids during wheelchair transport *(Under Review)*
- Use NU modifier for new holder (most common for accessories) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- NU modifier typically used for accessories *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document dual mobility pattern clearly with specific examples *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify walking aid type *(Under Review)*
- Explain functional need: safe transport of aids, prevents falls from dropped cane, maintains independence *(Under Review)*
