# K0018 - Detachable, Adjustable Height Armrest, Upper Portion

## Clinical Overview

Replacement upper portion of adjustable height armrest when base is still functional. For patients meeting K0017 criteria (requires different arm height AND uses wheelchair ≥2 hrs/day).

**Component Replacement:** Upper armrest portion only—use when base (K0017) is functional but upper portion damaged/worn. More economical than replacing complete assembly.

**Same Criteria as K0017:**
- Requires different arm height (patient measurements outside standard range) AND
- Spends ≥2 hours/day in wheelchair

**Bundling:** K0018 bundled with E0973.

**Unit:** Each (one upper armrest). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both armrests.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when patient meets K0017 criteria and upper armrest portion needs replacement while base functional. Justify why upper portion replacement adequate vs. complete assembly.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document damage to upper portion and that base is still functional, justifying component replacement vs. complete assembly.

**Documentation Required:**
- Patient continues to meet K0017 criteria (different arm height + 2+ hrs/day use)
- Upper armrest damage or wear requiring replacement
- Armrest base (K0017) still functional
- Justification why component replacement vs. complete assembly
- RB modifier (replacement)
