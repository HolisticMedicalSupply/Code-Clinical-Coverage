# E2210 - Bearings, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

E2210 represents replacement bearings for wheelchair wheels (propulsion wheels or caster wheels). Bearings are critical mechanical components that allow wheels to rotate smoothly on their axles. Over time, bearings wear out from regular use, environmental exposure (dirt, moisture), or heavy-duty use, leading to increased rolling resistance, difficulty propelling the wheelchair, wheel wobble, or grinding noises. Worn bearings significantly impact wheelchair function and can create safety hazards. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

Bearings are included in the wheelchair base code at initial issue and are considered integral components of the wheelchair. E2210 is only separately billable when bearings have worn out and require replacement to maintain wheelchair functionality. The reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair bearings varies based on usage intensity, terrain, and maintenance, but they typically last several years under normal conditions. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code. Bearings are included in the wheelchair base at initial issue. E2210 is only separately billable when replacing worn/failed bearings on an existing wheelchair within the 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of the wheelchair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Wheelchair dependency:** Patient uses manual wheelchair as primary mobility device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
2. **Bearing wear/failure:** Bearings are worn, damaged, or failed, affecting wheelchair function *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Impact on mobility:** Worn bearings cause propulsion difficulty, wheel resistance, safety concerns, or functional impairment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
4. **Within RUL:** Replacement within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order** from physician
- Document bearing wear or failure (grinding noise, wheel wobble, increased resistance, difficulty propelling)
- Impact on wheelchair function and patient mobility
- Reasonable useful lifetime consideration (time since last replacement, usage intensity)
- Specify quantity (number of bearings being replaced)
- Specify location (propulsion wheel vs. caster wheel bearings)
- **RB modifier** (replacement of a part of DME)

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial wheelchair issue (included in base code)
- Must be within reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair (typically 5 years for Medicare)
- Document specific functional impact of worn bearings
- Bearing quantity varies by wheelchair model - verify appropriate number
- Medicare LCD L33788 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Same as Medicare - replacement only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Bearing wear/failure affecting wheelchair function
- Within wheelchair's useful lifetime

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Physician **Fiscal Order**
- Document bearing wear/failure and symptoms (resistance, noise, wobble)
- Impact on wheelchair function and patient mobility
- Specify quantity and location of bearings
- RB modifier for replacement billing

**Important Notes:**

- Replacement only - not billable at initial wheelchair issue
- Document specific evidence of bearing wear or failure
- May require justification if replacing before typical wear timeline

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and billing procedures are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2210 - Wheelchair accessory, bearings, any type, replacement only, each"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependency)
- [ ] Quantity: Specify number of bearings being replaced
- [ ] Location: Propulsion wheel bearings OR caster wheel bearings (or both)
- [ ] Evidence of wear/failure (grinding, resistance, wobble, difficulty propelling)
- [ ] Impact on wheelchair function and patient mobility
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**

- [ ] RB modifier (replacement part)
- [ ] Document within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime of wheelchair
- [ ] Specify symptoms of bearing wear (grinding noise, increased resistance, wheel wobble)
- [ ] Impact on patient's ability to propel wheelchair

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] Document bearing wear/failure clearly
- [ ] Specify quantity and location

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately payable - included in wheelchair base"** - Billed at initial wheelchair issue. Fix: E2210 is REPLACEMENT ONLY. Only bill when replacing worn/failed bearings on existing wheelchair, not at initial wheelchair issue. Use RB modifier to indicate replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Insufficient documentation of bearing failure"** - No evidence of bearing wear documented. Fix: Document specific symptoms of bearing failure: grinding noise during wheel rotation, increased rolling resistance requiring more effort to propel, wheel wobble, or difficulty propelling wheelchair. Include patient/caregiver report of changes in wheelchair function. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Replaced before reasonable wear timeline"** - Bearings replaced too soon after previous replacement. Fix: Bearings typically last several years under normal use. If replacing earlier than expected, document reason: heavy use, environmental exposure (outdoor use, rain, dirt), manufacturing defect, or accident/damage. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Wheelchair outside reasonable useful lifetime"** - Base wheelchair no longer covered. Fix: Verify wheelchair is within 5-year reasonable useful lifetime for Medicare. Replacement parts generally not covered if wheelchair itself has exceeded RUL. If wheelchair is older than 5 years, may need to justify continued use or obtain new wheelchair. *(Under Review)*

5. **"Missing RB modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier when billing E2210 to indicate replacement of a part of existing DME. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Quantity not specified"** - Number of bearings not clear. Fix: Specify exact quantity of bearings being replaced. Different wheelchair models have different numbers of bearings (typically 2-4 bearings per wheel, varying by design). Bill appropriate quantity based on actual bearings being replaced. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**

- Always use **RB modifier** to indicate replacement part *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific symptoms: grinding noise, increased resistance, wheel wobble, difficulty propelling *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify quantity and location (e.g., "4 bearings - both rear propulsion wheels") *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include patient/caregiver report of functional changes (harder to push, unusual noises) *(Under Review)*
- Document impact on mobility and independence *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Ensure replacement is within wheelchair's 5-year reasonable useful lifetime *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If early replacement, document heavy use or environmental factors causing premature wear *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**

- Use **Fiscal Order** format *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document bearing failure symptoms clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify quantity and location of bearings *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain impact on wheelchair function and patient's ability to use wheelchair independently *(Under Review)*
