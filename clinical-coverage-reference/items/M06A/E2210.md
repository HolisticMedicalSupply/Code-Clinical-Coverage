# E2210 - Bearings, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement bearings for wheelchair wheels. Essential component for smooth wheelchair propulsion. Covered as replacement when bearings are worn and affecting mobility or safety.

**Replacement Only:** Bearings included in wheelchair base at initial issue. Only separately billable as replacement due to wear or failure.

**Unit:** Each (one bearing). Bill appropriate quantity for number of bearings being replaced.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when bearings worn and affecting wheelchair function. Document bearing wear/failure and impact on mobility.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document bearing condition and need for replacement to maintain wheelchair function.

**Documentation Required:**
- Evidence of bearing wear or failure
- Impact on wheelchair function (propulsion difficulty, wheel resistance, safety concern)
- Reasonable useful lifetime consideration (typically part of 5-year wheelchair life)
- RB modifier (replacement)
