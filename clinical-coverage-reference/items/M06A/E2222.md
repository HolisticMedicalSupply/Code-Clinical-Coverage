# E2222 - Solid Caster Tire With Integrated Wheel

## Clinical Overview

Solid rubber or plastic caster tire with integrated wheel for front wheels of manual wheelchair. Tire and wheel rim are single integrated unit. Simplifies replacement and maintenance.

**Integrated Unit:** Tire and wheel are one piece (compare to E2221 where tire is separate and removable). Replace entire unit as single component.

**Easier Replacement:** Integrated design simplifies replacement processâ€”entire unit replaced rather than removing tire from wheel.

**Solid Construction:** Hard rubber or plastic (no air, no foam). Maximum durability and maintenance-free.

**Caster Location:** Front wheels (typically smaller than rear propulsion wheels).

**Replacement Only:** Caster assemblies included in wheelchair base initially. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Unit:** Each (one caster assembly). Typically bill as pair (2 units) for both front casters.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered as replacement when caster assemblies worn or damaged. Integrated design appropriate for simplified maintenance.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Document caster assembly wear/damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Caster tire/wheel assembly wear or damage
- Patient's wheelchair use pattern
- RB modifier (replacement)
