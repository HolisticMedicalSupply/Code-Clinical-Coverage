# K0056 - Seat Height <17" or ≥21" for High Strength Lightweight/Ultralightweight

## Clinical Overview

Non-standard seat height for high strength lightweight (K0004) or ultralightweight (K0005) wheelchairs. For patients requiring seat height less than 17 inches OR equal to/greater than 21 inches due to short or tall stature.

**Standard Seat Height:** 17-19 inches included in wheelchair base. K0056 for non-standard heights outside this range.

**Short Stature (<17"):** Lower seat height for:
- Short stature patients requiring foot propulsion (feet must reach ground)
- Proper transfers requiring lower seat
- Pediatric or small adult patients

**Tall Stature (≥21"):** Higher seat height for:
- Tall patients requiring proper positioning
- Leg length requiring higher seat for comfort/function
- Proper knee angle for propulsion

**Must Use With:** K0004 (high strength lightweight), K0005 (ultralightweight), or K0002 (hemi wheelchair). NOT separately billable with standard wheelchairs.

**Only at Initial Issue or Replacement Base:** Not separately billable after wheelchair delivered—must be ordered with new wheelchair or complete base replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Covered when patient measurements justify non-standard seat height and wheelchair is K0004/K0005. Physical dimensions must document need. PT/OT evaluation recommended for complex rehab positioning assessment.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when non-standard seat height medically necessary. Prior approval may be required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document patient measurements and functional justification.

**Documentation Required:**
- Patient measurements:
  - Height (total body height)
  - Leg length (hip to floor, knee to floor)
  - Sitting measurements (popliteal height)
- Why non-standard seat height necessary:
  - For <17": Foot propulsion requires feet to reach ground, transfer safety
  - For ≥21": Leg length requires higher seat, proper knee angle for function
- Wheelchair type: Must be K0004, K0005, or K0002
- PT/OT evaluation recommended (positioning assessment, measurements)
- Functional justification (propulsion, transfers, positioning needs)
- Only billed at new wheelchair or replacement base delivery
