# E0995 - Calf Rest/Pad, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

The E0995 calf rest/pad is a replacement component for the elevating legrest assembly (E0990/K0195) that provides cushioned support for the calf/lower leg when the leg is elevated. The calf rest/pad attaches to the elevating legrest framework and supports the calf, preventing pressure at the back of the knee and providing comfortable leg elevation support. This is a **REPLACEMENT ONLY** code for the calf rest/pad component after the original wears out or is damaged.

Calf rest/pad replacement is medically necessary when the original calf rest/pad has worn out or been damaged, and continued calf support is required for ongoing medical conditions including lower extremity edema requiring continued leg elevation (lymphedema, venous insufficiency requiring therapeutic elevation during wheelchair use), musculoskeletal conditions preventing 90° knee flexion requiring elevating legrest support (knee contractures, arthritis, post-surgical restrictions), cast/brace requiring leg elevation support during healing, or post-surgical leg care requiring continued elevation and calf support. The medical reason for calf rest/pad replacement should match the original medical indication for elevating legrests - if patient still needs elevating legrests for edema/musculoskeletal/reclining support, worn calf rest/pad requires replacement to maintain functional leg elevation system. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL - REPLACEMENT ONLY, INCLUDED IN BASE INITIALLY:** Calf rest/pad is included as a component of the elevating legrest assembly (E0990/K0195) at initial dispensing and is NOT separately billable at initial issue. E0995 is ONLY for replacing worn or damaged calf rest/pad after the elevating legrest system already delivered and in use. *(verified from source)* **Medical reason required** in physician order specifying why replacement needed. *(verified from source)* **RB modifier** for replacement of DME part. *(verified from source)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. **RB modifier** (replacement of part). Physician order must specify medical reason for calf rest/pad replacement: continued edema management requiring elevation, musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion, cast/brace requiring leg support, or post-surgical leg care. Included in elevating legrest base at initial issue - separately billable as replacement only.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Replacement only. Physician order must specify medical reason for calf rest/pad (edema, cast/brace, post-surgical, musculoskeletal condition). Included in initial elevating legrest assembly - separate billing only for replacement component.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) - wheelchair dependence (Z99.3), knee pain (M25.569), venous insufficiency (I87.2)
- [ ] Medical reason statement for calf rest/pad replacement
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Specify medical reason** - edema, musculoskeletal condition, cast/brace, post-surgical
- [ ] Confirmation patient has elevating legrests (E0990/K0195) on wheelchair
- [ ] Explanation why calf rest/pad replacement needed (worn, damaged, continued medical necessity)
- [ ] **RB modifier** required
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order format
- [ ] **NOT billable at initial elevating legrest delivery** - REPLACEMENT ONLY
- [ ] Medical reason: continued edema management, musculoskeletal condition, cast/brace, or post-surgical care
- [ ] Verify patient has elevating legrests system
- [ ] RB modifier

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal Order format
- [ ] **REPLACEMENT ONLY**
- [ ] Medical reason documented
- [ ] Verify elevating legrests present

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial elevating legrest issue"** - E0995 billed when elevating legrests (E0990/K0195) first dispensed. Calf rest/pad included as component of elevating legrest assembly at initial delivery - NOT separately billable at initial issue. Fix: **Only bill E0995 when replacing worn/damaged calf rest/pad on elevating legrests already in use.** Verify elevating legrests previously delivered. Document: "Patient has elevating legrests (E0990 delivered [date]); calf rest/pad now worn requiring replacement for continued [edema management / knee support / leg elevation]." E0995 only for replacement after initial delivery. *(verified from source)*

2. **"No medical reason specified"** - Request for calf rest/pad replacement without medical reason explaining why replacement needed. Fix: **Physician order must specify medical reason for calf rest/pad replacement.** Medical reason should match ongoing condition requiring elevating legrests: "Calf rest/pad replacement required for continued edema management - patient has lymphedema requiring leg elevation during wheelchair use; worn calf rest/pad needs replacement to maintain functional elevation system" OR "Patient has knee contracture preventing 90° flexion requiring elevating legrest support; calf rest/pad damaged requiring replacement for continued leg positioning support." Medical reason connects replacement to ongoing medical need for leg elevation. *(verified from source)*

3. **"Patient doesn't have elevating legrests"** - Calf rest/pad ordered but patient doesn't have elevating legrest system. Calf rest/pad is component of elevating legrests (E0990/K0195) - cannot order separately. Fix: **Verify patient has elevating legrests on wheelchair before ordering calf rest/pad replacement.** Confirm patient meets one of three elevating legrest criteria (musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion, significant LE edema, or reclining back). If patient doesn't have elevating legrests, cannot order E0995 calf rest/pad component. Document: "Patient has elevating legrests (E0990) meeting criterion [1/2/3]; calf rest/pad component requires replacement." *(verified from source)*

4. **"Calf rest/pad not worn/damaged enough"** - Replacement requested but existing calf rest/pad still functional. Fix: Document wear or damage necessitating replacement: "Calf rest/pad worn through from daily use; padding compressed no longer providing adequate calf support; replacement required for functional leg elevation" OR "Calf rest/pad damaged; torn covering creating pressure points; replacement needed for safe leg support." Explain why replacement medically necessary vs. cosmetic preference. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Verify replacement only:** Cannot bill at initial elevating legrest delivery *(verified from source)*
- **Medical reason required:** Document ongoing condition requiring leg elevation *(verified from source)*
- **Confirm elevating legrests present:** Patient must have E0990/K0195 system *(verified from source)*
- **RB modifier:** Replacement of DME part *(verified from source)*
- **Connect to original criteria:** Medical reason for replacement should match original elevating legrest indication *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Same as Medicare:** Replacement only, medical reason required *(verified from source)*
- **Fiscal order:** NY Medicaid format *(verified from source)*
- **Verify elevating legrests:** Patient must have elevating legrest system *(verified from source)*

**Common Medical Reasons:**
- Continued edema management requiring leg elevation *(verified from source)*
- Musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion *(verified from source)*
- Cast/brace support during healing *(verified from source)*
