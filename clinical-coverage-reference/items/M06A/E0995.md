# E0995 - Calf Rest/Pad, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Calf rest/pad replacement component for elevating leg rest systems. For lower extremity edema, musculoskeletal conditions preventing 90째 knee flexion, cast/brace support, or post-surgical leg care.

**REPLACEMENT ONLY:** Included in elevating legrest assembly at initial issue. Only separately billable as replacement component.

**Medical Reason Required:** Physician order must specify medical reason for replacement (continued edema management, cast/brace support, musculoskeletal condition, post-surgical care).

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Written order required. **RB modifier** (replacement of part). Physician order must specify medical reason for calf rest/pad replacement: continued edema management requiring elevation, musculoskeletal condition preventing 90째 knee flexion, cast/brace requiring leg support, or post-surgical leg care. Included in elevating legrest base at initial issue - separately billable as replacement only.

### NY Medicaid: Fiscal order required. Replacement only. Physician order must specify medical reason for calf rest/pad (edema, cast/brace, post-surgical, musculoskeletal condition). Included in initial elevating legrest assembly - separate billing only for replacement component.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial issue"** - Calf rest/pad included as component of elevating legrest assembly (E0990, K0195) at initial dispensing. Only separately billable as replacement of worn/damaged component.

2. **"No medical reason specified"** - Physician order must specify medical reason for calf rest/pad: edema management requiring leg elevation, cast/brace support, musculoskeletal condition preventing standard knee flexion, or post-surgical leg care requiring elevation support.

3. **"Patient doesn't have elevating legrests"** - Calf rest/pad is component of elevating legrest system. Patient must have elevating legrests (E0990/K0195) on wheelchair. Verify patient meets elevating legrest criteria before ordering calf rest/pad replacement.
