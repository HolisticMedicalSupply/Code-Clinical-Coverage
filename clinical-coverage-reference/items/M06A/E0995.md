# E0995 - Calf Rest/Pad, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Calf rest/pad replacement for LE edema, musculoskeletal conditions preventing 90° knee flexion, cast/brace, or post-surgical care.

**REPLACEMENT ONLY:** Included in wheelchair base initially. Only billable as replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare/Medicaid:** Written order. Physician order specifying medical reason (edema, cast/brace, post-surgical, musculoskeletal condition). RB modifier. Included in base initially, separately billable as replacement only.

## Common Denials

1. **"Billed at initial issue"** - Included in base, replacement only.
2. **"No medical reason specified"** - Physician order must specify medical reason for calf rest/pad.
