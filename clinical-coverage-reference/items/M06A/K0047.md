# K0047 - Elevating Legrest, Upper Hanger Bracket, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement upper hanger bracket component for elevating legrest system. For component replacement when upper bracket damaged/worn. Patient must continue to meet elevating legrest coverage criteria.

**Elevating Legrest Criteria:** Patient must have covered elevating legrests (E0990 or K0195) and continue to meet ONE of three criteria:

2. Significant lower extremity edema requiring elevation, OR
3. Reclining back on wheelchair

**Component Replacement:** Upper hanger bracket only (attaches elevating legrest to wheelchair frame). More economical when only bracket damaged and rest of system functional.
