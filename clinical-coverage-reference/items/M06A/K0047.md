# K0047 - Elevating Legrest, Upper Hanger Bracket, Replacement

## Clinical Overview

Replacement upper hanger bracket component for elevating legrest system. For component replacement when upper bracket damaged/worn. Patient must continue to meet elevating legrest coverage criteria.

**Elevating Legrest Criteria:** Patient must have covered elevating legrests (E0990 or K0195) and continue to meet ONE of three criteria:
1. Musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90° knee flexion, OR
2. Significant lower extremity edema requiring elevation, OR
3. Reclining back on wheelchair

**Component Replacement:** Upper hanger bracket only (attaches elevating legrest to wheelchair frame). More economical when only bracket damaged and rest of system functional.

**Function:** Upper hanger bracket connects elevating legrest assembly to wheelchair frame and provides pivot point for leg elevation mechanism.

**Replacement Only:** Included at initial elevating legrest issue. Separately billable only as replacement.

**Bundling:** K0047 bundled with E0990, K0195, and power leg elevation systems at initial issue.

**Unit:** Each (one bracket). Typically bill as pair (2 units) if both legrest brackets need replacement.

## Coverage

**Medicare LCD:** Covered as replacement when patient continues to meet elevating legrest criteria and upper hanger bracket damaged. Document continued medical necessity for elevating legrests and bracket damage. RB modifier required.

**NY Medicaid:** Replacement only. Patient must continue to meet elevating legrest criteria. Document upper hanger bracket damage requiring replacement.

**Documentation Required:**
- Patient continues to meet ONE of three elevating legrest criteria:
  - Musculoskeletal condition preventing 90° knee flexion (measurements, cast/brace documentation)
  - Significant LE edema requiring elevation (edema measurements, photos)
  - Has reclining back wheelchair (specify HCPCS code)
- Upper hanger bracket damage/wear (cracked, broken, worn pivot mechanism)
- Justification why component replacement vs. complete elevating legrest assembly
- RB modifier (replacement)
