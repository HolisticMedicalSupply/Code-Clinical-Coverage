# E2227 - Gear Reduction Drive Wheel

## Clinical Overview

Gear reduction drive wheel for manual wheelchair. Provides mechanical advantage for patients with reduced upper extremity strength who can self-propel but have difficulty with standard wheelchair. Requires 1-year self-propulsion history.

**Mechanical Advantage:** Gear reduction system makes propulsion easier by reducing force required (similar to bicycle gears). Allows self-propulsion for patients with marginal UE strength.

**Strict Coverage Criteria (Medicare LCD L33792):** ALL three requirements must be met:
1. **1-year self-propulsion history** in manual wheelchair
2. **SPECIALTY EVALUATION** by PT/OT with wheelchair expertise and no financial relationship with supplier
3. **RESNA ATP involvement** with direct participation in evaluation

## Coverage

**Medicare LCD L33792:** Covered only when ALL three criteria met. High scrutiny—must document 1-year self-propulsion history, comprehensive evaluation, why standard wheelchair inadequate.

**NY Medicaid:** Prior approval required. Comprehensive evaluation documenting alternatives tried (standard wheelchair, different wheel configurations). PT/OT attestation required.

**Documentation Required:**
- 1-year history of self-propelling manual wheelchair
- Upper extremity strength limitations (MMT scores helpful)
- Specialty evaluation by PT/OT with wheelchair expertise (attestation of no financial relationship with supplier)
- RESNA ATP direct involvement and documentation
- Trial of standard wheelchair showing inadequacy
- Functional goals and expected improvement with gear reduction
- Why other alternatives insufficient (lighter wheelchair, different propulsion systems)
