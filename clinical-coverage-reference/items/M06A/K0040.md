# K0040 - Adjustable Angle Footplate

## Clinical Overview

Adjustable angle footplate for wheelchair footrest. Allows adjustment of footplate angle to accommodate limited ankle range of motion, foot drop, contractures, or orthopedic conditions requiring specific foot positioning.

**Adjustable Angle:** Footplate angle can be adjusted to accommodate ankle positioning needs (dorsiflexion or plantarflexion limitations). Standard footplates are typically fixed at 90-degree angle.

**Coverage by Wheelchair Type:**
- **Power Groups 3/4/5:** Separately billable
- **Power Groups 1-2:** Included (not separately billable)
- **Manual wheelchairs:** Check specific policy

**Bundling:** K0040 bundled with E0990 (elevating leg rests), E1010, E1012.

**Unit:** Each (one footplate). Bill with LT/RT modifiers for laterality. Typically bill as pair if both feet need adjustable angle.

## Coverage

**Medicare:** Separately billable for power Groups 3/4/5. Included with Groups 1-2. Document specific ankle ROM limitations and need for angle adjustment beyond standard 90-degree footplate. Bundled with elevating leg rests and certain specialty footrest systems.

**NY Medicaid:** Covered when adjustable angle medically necessary for ankle positioning. Prior approval may be required for power wheelchairs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*. Document ankle ROM measurements and positioning needs.

**Documentation Required:**
- Ankle ROM measurements (dorsiflexion and plantarflexion degrees)
- Diagnosis causing limited ankle ROM (foot drop, contracture, orthopedic condition)
- Why standard fixed-angle footplate inadequate
- Specific footplate angle required for proper positioning
- PT/OT evaluation with positioning assessment
- Impact of improper foot positioning (skin breakdown risk, comfort, function)
- Bilateral or unilateral need (bill with LT/RT modifiers)
