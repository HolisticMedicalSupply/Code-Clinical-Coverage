# A6550 - Wound Care Set for Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Electrical Pump

## Clinical Overview

A6550 represents a complete wound care dressing set (kit) used with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) electrical pumps for dressing changes. Each kit includes all components necessary for a complete NPWT dressing change: non-adherent porous foam or gauze dressings, drainage tubing to connect the wound dressing to the pump, and transparent occlusive film dressing to create an airtight seal over the wound. These dressing kits are essential supplies for maintaining effective negative pressure wound therapy. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** A6550 can ONLY be dispensed with active E2402 NPWT pump coverage. Maximum 15 dressing kits per wound per month. Licensed medical professionals must supervise or perform dressing changes. Monthly wound measurements documenting healing progress are MANDATORY. KX modifier required when Medicare coverage criteria met. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "A6550 - Wound care set for NPWT pump"
- [ ] Active E2402 NPWT pump order on file
- [ ] ICD-10 wound diagnosis code **with 5th digit** specifying wound site
- [ ] Wound measurements: Length × Width × Depth (cm)
- [ ] Dressing change frequency (typical: 2-3 times per week = 8-15 changes/month)
- [ ] Licensed professional supervising/performing dressing changes (name, credentials)
- [ ] Quantity needed per month (maximum 15)
- [ ] Expected duration (follows E2402 coverage period, max 4 months)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Standard Written Order (SWO) completed
- [ ] Monthly wound assessment schedule established with licensed professional
- [ ] Healing progression documentation plan (monthly L×W×D measurements)
- [ ] KX modifier will be applied when billing (criteria met)
- [ ] Refill authorization process documented (30-day contact, 10-day delivery)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization obtained for A6550
- [ ] E2402 DVS authorization active (required before A6550 can be dispensed)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No active E2402 pump coverage"** - Pump not covered or expired. Fix: Cannot bill A6550 without active E2402 coverage. Ensure E2402 authorization active before dispensing dressing kits. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No KX modifier"** (Medicare) - Modifier missing from claim. Fix: Add KX modifier to indicate all coverage criteria met (E2402 active, licensed professional supervision, monthly documentation). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Quantity exceeds limit"** - >15 kits requested. Fix: Maximum 15 per wound per month. Justify if higher quantity needed (more frequent dressing changes ordered by physician for specific medical reason). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No monthly wound measurements"** - Missing healing documentation. Fix: Licensed professional must document wound measurements (L×W×D) monthly with comparison to prior month showing healing progression. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"ICD-10 code not specific to 5th digit"** - Generic wound code used. Fix: Use wound-specific ICD-10 code with 5th digit identifying anatomical site (e.g., L89.153 = Stage 3 sacral pressure ulcer, not L89.1 = pressure ulcer unspecified site). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No licensed professional supervision documented"** - Patient/family performing changes unsupervised. Fix: Licensed medical professional (MD, DO, PA, RN, LPN, PT) must directly assess wounds regularly and supervise/perform dressing changes. Document who is performing changes. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No DVS authorization"** (Medicaid) - A6550 billed without DVS. Fix: Obtain DVS authorization for A6550. Ensure E2402 DVS authorization also active. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"No measurable healing over prior month"** - Wound not improving. Fix: Coverage ends if no healing progression. Document why NPWT should continue or consider alternative treatment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

9. **"Treatment exceeded 4 months"** - Duration limit exceeded. Fix: Document continued healing month-over-month to justify extension beyond 4 months. Special justification required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

10. **"Too early refill"** - Delivered before 10-day window. Fix: Contact beneficiary no sooner than 30 days before supply end, deliver no sooner than 10 days before end of current supply. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
