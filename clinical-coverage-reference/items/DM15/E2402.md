# E2402 - Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Electrical Pump

## Clinical Overview

E2402 represents a negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) electrical pump, also commonly known as a "wound VAC" (vacuum-assisted closure). This device applies controlled negative pressure (suction) to a wound through a sealed dressing system, promoting healing by removing excess fluid, reducing edema, increasing blood flow, and stimulating granulation tissue formation. NPWT is used for chronic, non-healing wounds that have failed conventional wound care for at least 30 days. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** Both Medicare and NY Medicaid require documented failure of conservative treatment for ≥30 days before NPWT approval. This is NOT a first-line wound treatment. Monthly wound measurements documenting healing progression are MANDATORY for continued coverage. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E2402 - Negative pressure wound therapy electrical pump"
- [ ] ICD-10 wound diagnosis code with anatomical site (5th digit specific)
- [ ] Wound measurements: Length × Width × Depth (cm)
- [ ] Wound location (anatomical description)
- [ ] Wound etiology (pressure, diabetic, venous, arterial, mixed, surgical, traumatic)
- [ ] Duration of wound (must be ≥30 days for chronic wounds)
- [ ] Conservative treatment attempts (≥30 days) with specific therapies:
  - [ ] Moist wound dressings (type, duration)
  - [ ] Debridement (if applicable - dates, method)
  - [ ] Nutritional assessment/intervention
  - [ ] Wound-specific therapy (pressure relief, offloading, compression, etc.)
- [ ] Reason why conservative care failed
- [ ] Why NPWT medically necessary
- [ ] Expected duration of therapy
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) completed
- [ ] Plan monthly wound assessments by licensed professional
- [ ] Document wound contraindications ruled out (osteomyelitis, cancer, fistula)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization obtained for first 30 days

- [ ] RR modifier for monthly rental
- [ ] Contact information: Bureau of Medical Review 1-800-342-3005

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Conservative treatment <30 days"** - Insufficient duration. Fix: Must document ≥30 days of appropriate conservative care before NPWT approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No wound-specific therapy documented"** - Missing pressure relief, offloading, or compression. Fix: Pressure ulcers need Group 2/3 support surface + repositioning; diabetic ulcers need offloading; venous ulcers need compression. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No monthly wound measurements"** - Missing healing progression documentation. Fix: Document L×W×D measurements monthly with comparison to prior month showing healing or explaining lack of progress. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No measurable healing"** - Wound not improving. Fix: If no healing over 1 month, coverage ends. Consider alternative treatments or document why NPWT should continue despite lack of progression. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Contraindication present"** - Osteomyelitis, cancer, or fistula. Fix: Treat osteomyelitis first, rule out malignancy, close fistula before NPWT. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Inadequate blood supply"** - Arterial insufficiency wound without vascular optimization. Fix: Vascular evaluation, revascularization if needed, document adequate perfusion (ABI, TcPO2). *(Under Review)*

7. **"No DVS authorization"** (Medicaid) - Authorization not obtained. Fix: Obtain DVS authorization before delivery. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Treatment >4 months without justification"** - Exceeded maximum duration. Fix: Document continued healing progression month-over-month to justify extension beyond 4 months. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document complete ≥30-day conservative care trial with specific wound-specific therapies *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include wound measurements (L×W×D in cm) in initial order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify wound etiology and anatomical location precisely *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete WOPD before pump delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Arrange monthly wound assessments by licensed professional (MD, DO, PA, RN, LPN, PT) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document healing progression monthly (compare surface area, depth, granulation) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Rule out contraindications (order X-ray for osteomyelitis if suspected, ensure no cancer/fistula) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For pressure ulcers: Document Group 2/3 support surface + turning/positioning protocol *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For diabetic ulcers: Document comprehensive diabetes management + offloading device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For venous ulcers: Document compression therapy (30-40 mmHg) + leg elevation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
