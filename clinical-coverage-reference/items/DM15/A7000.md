# A7000 - Canister, Disposable, Used with Suction Pump

## Clinical Overview

A7000 represents a disposable collection canister used with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) pumps to collect wound exudate, fluid, and drainage during vacuum-assisted wound healing. The canister is a sealed, disposable container that attaches to the NPWT pump (E2402) and collects fluid removed from the wound bed by negative pressure suction. Canisters must be changed regularly based on drainage volume and manufacturer specifications. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** A7000 can ONLY be billed when the patient has an active E2402 NPWT pump in use. This is a supply item dependent on the pump equipment. Both Medicare and NY Medicaid limit quantities to 10 canisters per month unless high-volume drainage (>90 ml/day) is documented. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

1. **Active E2402 NPWT pump coverage** - Cannot bill A7000 without active pump *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Wound type** - Same covered wound types as E2402:
   - Chronic Stage 3/4 pressure ulcers
   - Diabetic/neuropathic ulcers
   - Venous insufficiency ulcers
   - Arterial insufficiency ulcers
   - Chronic mixed etiology ulcers ≥30 days
   - Post-surgical wound dehiscence
   - Traumatic wounds *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity Limits:**

- **Standard quantity:** Maximum 10 canister sets per month *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **High-volume drainage:** Higher quantities allowed if documentation shows **>90 ml exudate/day** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- High-volume wounds may require stationary pump with largest capacity canister
- Maximum 1-month quantity dispensed at a time *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Active E2402 pump order and coverage
- Wound diagnosis (same ICD-10 codes as E2402)
- For quantities >10/month: Document wound drainage volume (ml/day)
- Monthly wound assessments showing continued NPWT need
- Medical record showing healing progression or justification for continued therapy

**Refill Requirements:**

- Contact beneficiary **no sooner than 30 days before supply end** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Deliver **no sooner than 10 days before supply end** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Obtain affirmative patient response documenting continued need

**Important Notes:**

- Coverage duration follows E2402 pump (up to 4 months maximum)
- Monthly wound documentation and healing progression required
- LCD L33821 (Noridian DME MAC Jurisdiction A for NY)
- Billed as supply code with active E2402 coverage

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - active E2402 coverage required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity Limits:**
- **Standard:** Maximum 10 canisters per month *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **High-volume drainage:** Higher quantities with **>90 ml/day** drainage documented *(Under Review)*
- Medicaid pricing: **$4.35 per canister** (as of 2021 - verify current rates)

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Fiscal order from licensed practitioner specifying **"A7000 disposable canister"** (not generic description) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must be billed with active E2402 pump coverage
- Supplier must maintain documentation of medical necessity
- For quantities >10/month: Document high-volume drainage
- DVS or prior approval may apply based on quantity *(Under Review)*

**Important Notes:**

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid/Medicare ID
- [ ] Specific code: "A7000 - Disposable canister for NPWT pump"
- [ ] Active E2402 NPWT pump order on file
- [ ] ICD-10 wound diagnosis code (same as E2402)
- [ ] Quantity needed per month (maximum 10 standard)
- [ ] If >10/month: Document wound drainage volume (ml/day)
- [ ] Expected duration (follows E2402 coverage period)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] E2402 pump coverage active and documented
- [ ] Monthly wound assessment schedule established
- [ ] Refill authorization documented (30-day advance contact, 10-day delivery window)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order specifies "A7000 disposable canister" (not generic)
- [ ] E2402 DVS authorization active
- [ ] High-volume drainage documented if >10/month requested
- [ ] Direct bill setup with supplier

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No active E2402 pump coverage"** - Pump not covered or expired. Fix: Cannot bill A7000 without active E2402 coverage. Ensure pump coverage active before billing canisters. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Quantity exceeds limit"** - >10 canisters requested without justification. Fix: Document wound drainage volume >90 ml/day to justify higher quantities. Include wound assessment showing high exudate volume. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Too early refill"** - Delivered before 10-day window. Fix: Contact beneficiary no sooner than 30 days before supply end, deliver no sooner than 10 days before end. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Generic description on order"** (Medicaid) - Order doesn't specify A7000. Fix: Fiscal order must state "A7000 disposable canister" not "wound vac supplies" or generic description. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No wound progression documentation"** - Missing monthly assessments. Fix: Monthly wound measurements documenting healing or medical necessity for continued NPWT required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"E2402 coverage ended"** - Pump coverage exceeded 4 months without healing. Fix: A7000 coverage ends when E2402 coverage ends. Cannot bill canisters after pump denial. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No medical necessity documentation"** - Missing wound records. Fix: Supplier must maintain documentation showing continued NPWT need and wound status. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Ensure E2402 pump coverage is active before billing A7000 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Limit quantities to 10/month unless high-volume drainage documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document wound drainage volume (ml/day) if requesting >10/month *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Follow refill timing requirements (30-day contact, 10-day delivery window) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Maintain monthly wound assessment documentation showing continued NPWT need *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Maximum 1-month supply at a time *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Coverage follows E2402 duration (up to 4 months) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- Fiscal order must specify "A7000 disposable canister" exactly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Verify E2402 DVS authorization is active *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Direct bill at $4.35 per canister (2021 pricing - verify current) *(Under Review)*
- Maximum 10 per month enforced unless high drainage (>90 ml/day) documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Maintain proof of delivery and medical necessity documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- DVS or prior approval may be required for high quantities *(Under Review)*
- Always bill with active E2402 coverage *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
