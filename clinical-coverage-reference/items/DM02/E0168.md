# E0168 - Heavy Duty/Bariatric Commode

## Clinical Overview

The E0168 is an extra wide and/or heavy duty commode designed for bariatric patients or those with severe spasticity requiring reinforced construction. It provides greater weight capacity and width than standard commodes. This code is used when the patient meets standard commode criteria AND requires the enhanced capacity due to weight, body measurements, or severe spasticity.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Must meet ALL E0163 criteria (confined to room/level/home without toilet)
- **PLUS** patient weighs ≥300 pounds (bariatric requirement)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Detailed Written Order (DWO) required before claim submission
- Same documentation as E0163 (confinement status, medical necessity)
- **PLUS** document patient weight ≥300 lbs in medical record
- KX modifier on claim certifies all criteria met
- Weight must be documented in patient's medical chart
- Proof of delivery mandatory

**Important Notes:**
- **DENIED if patient weighs <300 lbs** - must use E0163 instead
- Weight documentation is CRITICAL - must be in medical record
- Both confinement AND weight criteria must be met
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime
- May be with or without arms, mobile or stationary

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0163 (cannot use regular toilet)
- **PLUS** one of the following:
  - Patient weight >300 lbs, OR
  - Severe spasticity requiring reinforced frame, OR
  - Body measurements exceed standard commode capacity

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Same as E0163 (fiscal order, DVS authorization, medical necessity)
- **PLUS** document weight >300 lbs OR severe spasticity OR body measurements
- If weight <300 lbs, must justify based on spasticity or body measurements
- If patient <300 lbs without other justification, payment based on least costly alternative (E0163)
- Frequency: F5 (once every 5 years)
- DVS authorization REQUIRED before delivery

**Important Notes:**
- Weight must be documented if that's the justification
- If using spasticity as justification, document severity and reinforcement need
- If using body measurements, provide specific measurements
- Medicaid will downcode to E0163 if heavy duty not justified

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and authorization processes are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All E0163 requirements (confinement documentation)
- [ ] Specific code: "E0168 - Heavy duty/extra wide commode"
- [ ] Patient weight documented (if ≥300 lbs Medicare, >300 lbs Medicaid)
- [ ] OR documentation of severe spasticity requiring reinforced frame
- [ ] OR body measurements exceeding standard commode capacity
- [ ] ICD-10 codes including obesity code if applicable
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document patient weight ≥300 lbs in medical record
- [ ] Document patient meets E0163 confinement criteria
- [ ] Weight must be current (recent measurement)

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained before delivery
- [ ] Document weight >300 lbs OR severe spasticity OR body measurements
- [ ] If <300 lbs, provide detailed justification for heavy duty model
- [ ] Specific prescription: "E0168 heavy duty commode"

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Weight criteria not met"** - Patient weighs <300 lbs without other justification. Fix: If patient <300 lbs, use E0163 unless severe spasticity or body measurements justify E0168.

2. **"Weight not documented"** - Weight not in medical record. Fix: Document current weight in patient's chart.

3. **"Least costly alternative"** (Medicaid) - Patient <300 lbs and no spasticity justification. Fix: Use E0163, or document severe spasticity or body measurements requiring heavy duty model.

4. **"Confinement criteria not met"** - Heavy duty justified but patient doesn't meet basic commode criteria. Fix: First establish E0163 confinement criteria.

5. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain DVS authorization before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **CRITICAL**: Patient must weigh ≥300 lbs - this is non-negotiable for Medicare
- Document weight in medical record (not just on prescription)
- Use recent weight measurement (not from years ago)
- Include obesity ICD-10 code (E66.x)
- Document both confinement AND weight criteria
- KX modifier certifies both criteria are met

**Medicaid:**
- Document weight if >300 lbs - include actual weight measurement
- If weight 250-300 lbs, may still qualify if:
  - Severe spasticity requires reinforced construction, or
  - Body width measurements exceed standard commode width
- For spasticity justification:
  - Document specific spasticity diagnosis (G80.x, G82.x)
  - Explain how spasticity creates need for reinforced frame
- For body measurement justification:
  - Provide specific width/girth measurements
  - Explain why standard commode width inadequate
- DVS authorization required - supplier handles this
- Frequency F5 (every 5 years) vs F3 for standard commode

## Related Codes

- **E0163** - Standard commode with fixed arms - Least costly alternative for patients <300 lbs

- **E0165** - Commode with detachable arms - May also come in heavy duty if both features needed (arms + weight capacity)

- **E0167** - Commode pail replacement - Compatible with E0168
