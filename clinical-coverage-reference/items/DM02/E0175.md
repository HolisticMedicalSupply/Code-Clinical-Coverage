# E0175 - Footrest for Commode

## Clinical Overview

A footrest for commode use provides lower extremity support during toileting. While this may be medically necessary for patients with postural instability, leg weakness, amputation, or pressure ulcer risk, **Medicare does not cover this item**, considering it a comfort/convenience item rather than primarily medical. NY Medicaid does cover footrests with proper medical justification.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- **NOT COVERED** by Medicare

**Documentation Requirements:**
- N/A - Item not covered

**Important Notes:**
- **Use GY modifier** (statutory exclusion) when billing
- Medicare considers footrests as **not primarily medical in nature**
- Considered convenience/comfort item
- **No reimbursement available** under Medicare
- Patients may purchase out-of-pocket if desired
- Per LCD L33736, not reasonable and necessary

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient requires lower extremity support while using commode
- Medical necessity for one of the following:
  - Inability to bear weight on feet
  - Postural instability requiring foot support
  - Leg weakness preventing safe foot placement
  - Amputation requiring support
  - Pressure ulcer prevention requiring leg elevation/support

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with medical necessity statement
- DVS authorization REQUIRED before delivery
- Document medical necessity for footrest (postural support, safety, pressure relief)
- Specify whether one or two footrests needed
- Can bill quantity 1 or 2 depending on medical need
- Frequency: F3 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required before delivery
- Must have existing covered commode
- Document specific medical need (not comfort/convenience)
- Functional assessment supporting need for foot support

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** DVS authorization required; must document medical necessity.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and Medicaid ID (Medicare patients: not applicable)
- [ ] Specific code: "E0175 - Footrest for commode"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting lower extremity support need
- [ ] Medical necessity statement (postural support, safety, pressure relief)
- [ ] Documentation of existing covered commode
- [ ] Quantity needed (1 or 2)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **INFORM PATIENT**: Not covered by Medicare
- [ ] If billing Medicare, use GY modifier to indicate statutory exclusion
- [ ] Patient may choose to purchase out-of-pocket

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained by supplier before delivery
- [ ] Specific medical justification (not comfort only)
- [ ] Functional assessment showing need for foot support
- [ ] Document safety concerns without footrest

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not covered"** (Medicare) - Medicare does not cover this item. Fix: Inform patient; consider out-of-pocket purchase or Medicaid if eligible.

2. **"Comfort item only"** (Medicaid) - Insufficient medical justification. Fix: Document specific medical need (postural instability, leg weakness, pressure ulcer risk) with functional assessment.

3. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before authorization. Fix: Supplier must wait for DVS approval.

4. **"No commode on record"** - Patient doesn't have documented covered commode. Fix: Verify patient has existing commode; footrest is accessory only.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Be aware: NOT COVERED**
- Inform patients this is not a Medicare-covered item
- If patient wants footrest, options are:
  - Out-of-pocket purchase
  - Check if patient has Medicaid (may be covered)
- Use GY modifier if submitting to Medicare to indicate non-covered item
- Document for medical record even if not covered

**Medicaid:**
- Must document MEDICAL necessity, not comfort/convenience
- Good justifications:
  - "Patient has severe postural instability (R26.81) and cannot safely sit on commode without bilateral foot support for balance"
  - "Patient has lower extremity weakness (M62.81) and legs dangle unsupported, creating pressure ulcer risk"
  - "Patient is bilateral lower extremity amputee (Z89.619) requiring support surfaces for residual limbs during commode use"
- Include functional assessment:
  - What happens without footrest? (unsafe positioning, falls risk, pressure concern)
  - How does footrest address medical need?
- Specify quantity (1 or 2) based on need:
  - Single central footrest (quantity 1)
  - Bilateral footrests for each leg (quantity 2)
- DVS authorization required - supplier handles this

## Related Codes

- **E0163/E0165/E0168** - Commode chairs - Footrest is accessory to these base codes

**Note:** Footrest is NOT included with commode at initial issue for Medicaid (separately billable). Medicare does not cover footrests at all.
