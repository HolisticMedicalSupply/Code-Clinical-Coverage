# E0276 - Fracture Bedpan (Low-Profile)

## Clinical Overview

A fracture bedpan (also called a low-profile bedpan) is a specialized bedpan with a shallow, tapered design for patients who cannot tolerate standard bedpan positioning. This is medically necessary for patients with hip fractures, pelvic fractures, spinal precautions, or other orthopedic conditions that prevent standard bedpan positioning. The low-profile design allows use without elevating the hips as much as a standard bedpan requires.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient is bed-confined (same as E0275)
- **PLUS** one of the following:
  - Fracture requiring low-profile bedpan (hip, pelvis, spine)
  - Orthopedic condition preventing standard bedpan positioning
  - Post-surgical precautions requiring low-profile design
  - Cannot tolerate standard bedpan due to medical condition

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Same as E0275 (SWO, proof of delivery, bed-confined documentation)
- **PLUS** document fracture or orthopedic reason requiring fracture pan specifically
- Physician order stating medical necessity for fracture pan (not just generic "bedpan")
- Positioning restrictions documented

**Important Notes:**
- Must justify fracture pan vs. standard bedpan (E0275)
- Low-profile design must be medically necessary
- Typically related to fractures or orthopedic positioning restrictions

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0275 (bed confinement, unable to use commode/toilet)
- **PLUS** one of the following:
  - Hip fracture requiring low-profile bedpan
  - Pelvic fracture with positioning restrictions
  - Cannot tolerate standard bedpan due to body positioning restrictions
  - Hip precautions (post-THR, hip fracture)
  - Spinal precautions preventing standard bedpan positioning

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Same as E0275 (fiscal order, DVS authorization, medical necessity)
- **PLUS** document fracture or condition requiring low-profile bedpan
- Specify positioning restrictions:
  - Hip precautions (no flexion >90 degrees, no adduction, etc.)
  - Spinal precautions (log roll only, no twisting)
  - Pelvic fracture with weight-bearing restrictions
- Frequency: F4 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required
- Must justify why standard bedpan (E0275) inadequate
- Document specific orthopedic restrictions

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** DVS authorization required; must document fracture or positioning restrictions.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All E0275 requirements (bed confinement documentation)
- [ ] Specific code: "E0276 - Bedpan, fracture (low-profile)"
- [ ] ICD-10 code for fracture or orthopedic condition
- [ ] Documentation of fracture or positioning restriction requiring low-profile design
- [ ] Specific positioning precautions (hip precautions, spinal precautions, etc.)
- [ ] Explanation why standard bedpan cannot be tolerated
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document specific fracture or orthopedic condition
- [ ] Explain positioning restrictions preventing standard bedpan use
- [ ] Specify medical necessity for low-profile design

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained by supplier before delivery
- [ ] Detailed orthopedic/positioning documentation
- [ ] Specific precautions listed (hip precautions, spinal precautions, etc.)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Standard bedpan adequate"** - Insufficient justification for fracture pan. Fix: Document specific fracture or positioning restrictions requiring low-profile design.

2. **"Fracture/orthopedic condition not documented"** - Generic "bedpan" order without fracture justification. Fix: Specify E0276 and document fracture/orthopedic reason.

3. **"Positioning restrictions not clear"** - Did not explain why standard bedpan cannot be tolerated. Fix: Detail specific positioning precautions (hip flexion limits, spinal precautions, etc.).

4. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient could use standard bedpan. Fix: Provide orthopedic documentation showing need for low-profile design.

5. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain DVS authorization before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Be very specific about fracture or orthopedic condition:
  - "Patient has hip fracture (S72.001A) with hip precautions: no flexion >90°, no adduction past midline. Standard bedpan requires hip flexion >90° for positioning. Fracture pan required for safe toileting within precautions."
- Document positioning restrictions in detail
- Include orthopedic surgeon's post-op orders if applicable
- Specify duration of need (often temporary while fracture heals or post-op precautions in place)

**Medicaid:**
- DVS authorization required - supplier handles this
- Very detailed orthopedic documentation needed
- List specific precautions:
  - Hip precautions: No flexion >90°, no adduction, no internal rotation
  - Spinal precautions: Log roll only, maintain spinal alignment, no twisting
  - Pelvic fracture: Non-weight-bearing, no hip flexion
- Explain biomechanics:
  - Standard bedpan requires lifting hips and positioning under buttocks
  - Fracture pan slides under patient from side with minimal hip elevation
  - Low profile allows use within positioning restrictions
- Include surgical orders or orthopedic documentation

## Related Codes

- **E0275** - Bedpan, standard - Use when no fracture or positioning restrictions exist

- **E0163/E0165** - Commode chairs - Less confining option for patients who can transfer (even with fracture after certain healing period)
