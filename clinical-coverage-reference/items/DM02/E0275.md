# E0275 - Standard Bedpan

## Clinical Overview

A standard bedpan is used for patients who are bed-confined or room-confined and physically unable to utilize commode or regular toilet facilities. This is a standard-profile bedpan (metal or plastic) for use in the bed. Patients who can tolerate standard bedpan positioning should use E0275; patients with fractures or positioning restrictions requiring low-profile design should use E0276 (fracture pan).

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient is bed-confined OR room-confined
- Physically unable to utilize commode or regular toilet facilities
- Medical necessity for toileting in bed

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician prescription required
- Document bed-confined or room-confined status in medical record
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required
- Proof of delivery required
- Typically limited to 1 per 12 months

**Important Notes:**
- Patient must be truly confined to bed or room
- Not for convenience when patient can use commode or toilet
- Document medical reason for confinement

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient confined to bed
- Unable to use commode/toilet due to medical condition
- Post-surgical immobilization requiring bed rest
- Severe mobility limitations preventing safe transfer to commode/toilet

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with medical necessity statement
- DVS authorization REQUIRED before delivery
- Document medical necessity for bedpan:
  - Bed confinement reason
  - Inability to transfer safely
  - Medical restriction requiring bed rest
- Frequency: F4 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required before delivery
- Must document why patient cannot use commode (more mobile option)
- Specify bed-confined or room-confined status

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** DVS authorization required; must document confinement status.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0275 - Bedpan, standard"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for underlying condition causing confinement
- [ ] Documentation of bed-confined or room-confined status
- [ ] Medical necessity statement
- [ ] Reason patient cannot use commode or toilet
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document patient is bed-confined or room-confined
- [ ] Explain why patient cannot utilize commode or toilet
- [ ] Medical restriction or immobilization documentation

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained by supplier before delivery
- [ ] Detailed confinement documentation
- [ ] Explain why commode is inadequate (patient more confined than commode criteria)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient not sufficiently confined. Fix: Document bed confinement or room confinement with specific medical reason.

2. **"Commode more appropriate"** - Patient could use commode instead. Fix: Explain why patient is more confined than commode criteria (bed-bound vs. room-bound).

3. **"Frequency exceeded"** - Ordered too soon after previous bedpan. Fix: Typically 1 per 12 months (Medicare) or every 3 years (Medicaid); justify if earlier replacement needed.

4. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain DVS authorization before delivery.

5. **"Insufficient documentation"** - Confinement status unclear. Fix: Be specific about bed confinement or room confinement and medical reason.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Clearly state patient is bed-confined or room-confined
- Document specific medical reason:
  - Post-surgical bed rest orders
  - Severe mobility limitation preventing any transfer
  - Complete immobilization due to fractures/injuries
  - Neurological condition requiring complete bed rest
- Explain why patient cannot use commode (which allows some mobility)
- Include expected duration of need if temporary

**Medicaid:**
- DVS authorization required - supplier handles this
- Very specific confinement documentation needed
- Differentiate from commode criteria:
  - Commode = room-confined, can sit on chair
  - Bedpan = bed-confined, cannot transfer even to bedside commode
- Document safety concerns with any transfer attempts
- Include mobility assessment showing complete bed confinement
- Specify if fracture pan (E0276) needed instead

## Related Codes

- **E0276** - Bedpan, fracture - Low-profile fracture pan for patients with hip/pelvic fractures or positioning restrictions. Use when patient cannot tolerate standard bedpan positioning.

- **E0163/E0165** - Commode chairs - Less confining option for patients who can transfer to bedside chair

- **E0325/E0326** - Urinals - For urination only; may be used with bedpan for bowel elimination
