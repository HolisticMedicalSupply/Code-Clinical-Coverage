# E0325 - Male Urinal

## Clinical Overview

A male urinal (jug-type) is used for male patients who are bed-confined or room-confined and physically unable to utilize regular toilet facilities or commode for urination. This allows for urination without transfer to bathroom or commode. It may be used for incontinence management, mobility limitations, or situations where frequent bathroom access is impractical due to patient's medical condition.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient is bed-confined OR room-confined
- Male patient
- Physically unable to utilize regular toilet facilities or commode for urination
- Medical necessity for urinal use

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician prescription required
- Document bed-confined or room-confined status
- Standard Written Order (SWO) with practitioner signature
- Proof of delivery required
- Typically limited to 1 per 12 months

**Important Notes:**
- Patient must be confined (bed or room)
- Not for convenience when patient can access bathroom
- Male-specific device (anatomically designed for males)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Male patient with urinary incontinence management needs
- Inability to ambulate to bathroom for urination
- Bed confinement or severe mobility impairment
- Post-surgical recovery requiring limited activity

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with medical necessity statement
- DVS authorization REQUIRED before delivery
- Document medical necessity:
  - Incontinence diagnosis if applicable
  - Mobility limitation preventing bathroom access
  - Bed confinement status
- Frequency: F3 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required before delivery
- Document why patient cannot access bathroom/commode for urination
- May be used in conjunction with bedpan (for bowel elimination)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** DVS authorization required; must document medical necessity.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0325 - Urinal, male"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for condition causing confinement/limitation
- [ ] Documentation of bed-confined or room-confined status OR mobility limitation
- [ ] Medical necessity statement for urinal use
- [ ] Confirm patient is male
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document patient is bed-confined or room-confined
- [ ] Explain why patient cannot utilize toilet or commode for urination
- [ ] Medical restriction or immobilization documentation

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained by supplier before delivery
- [ ] Detailed mobility or confinement documentation
- [ ] Incontinence diagnosis if applicable
- [ ] Functional limitations assessment

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient not sufficiently confined or limited. Fix: Document bed/room confinement or severe mobility limitation preventing bathroom access.

2. **"Patient can use toilet/commode"** - Patient appears able to access toilet. Fix: Explain specific medical reason patient cannot access bathroom (bed rest orders, severe weakness, frequent urination needs).

3. **"Gender mismatch"** - E0325 ordered for female patient. Fix: Use E0326 for female patients.

4. **"Frequency exceeded"** - Ordered too soon. Fix: Typically 1 per 12 months (Medicare) or every 3 years (Medicaid).

5. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain DVS authorization before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document bed-confined or room-confined status clearly
- Specific medical reasons:
  - Post-surgical bed rest with urinary frequency
  - Severe mobility limitation making bathroom access unsafe
  - Bed confinement due to medical condition
  - Frequent urination needs making repeated bathroom trips impractical
- Explain why commode inadequate (patient more confined than commode criteria)
- Include expected duration if temporary

**Medicaid:**
- DVS authorization required - supplier handles this
- Document medical necessity in detail:
  - "Patient bed-confined post-CVA with left hemiplegia (I69.354), unable to transfer to commode or ambulate to bathroom. Urinal needed for urinary elimination."
  - "Patient has functional urinary incontinence (R39.81) with urgency and frequency requiring immediate access. Mobility impairment (R26.2) prevents timely bathroom access."
- Differentiate urinal use from commode/toilet use:
  - Urinal = for urination only, can be used in bed without transfer
  - Commode = requires transfer to chair, used for bowel and bladder
  - Toilet = requires ambulation to bathroom
- Include frequency/urgency considerations if applicable
- Document safety concerns with bathroom access

## Related Codes

- **E0326** - Urinal, female - Female-specific urinal device

- **E0275/E0276** - Bedpans - Used for bowel elimination; may be used together with urinal

- **E0163/E0165** - Commode chairs - Less confining option for patients who can transfer

**Note:** Urinal is for urination only. Patients may need bedpan or commode for bowel elimination.
