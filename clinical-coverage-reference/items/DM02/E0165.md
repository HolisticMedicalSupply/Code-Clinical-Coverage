# E0165 - Commode with Detachable Arms

## Clinical Overview

The E0165 commode has detachable (removable) arms that facilitate transfers to and from the commode. This model is appropriate when the patient meets standard commode criteria (E0163) AND requires the ability to remove arms for side transfers or needs extra width access due to body configuration. The detachable arms allow caregivers or patients to perform safer, easier transfers.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Must meet ALL E0163 criteria (confined to room/level/home without toilet)
- **PLUS** one of the following:
  - Detachable arms necessary for patient transfer (from bed/wheelchair), OR
  - Patient body configuration requires extra width for transfer access

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Detailed Written Order (DWO) required before claim submission
- Same documentation as E0163 (confinement status, medical necessity)
- **PLUS** document specific need for detachable arms:
  - Transfer method requiring arm removal, OR
  - Body measurements requiring extra width access
- KX modifier on claim certifies all criteria met
- Proof of delivery mandatory

**Important Notes:**
- Must meet E0163 criteria first (confinement)
- Additional justification required for detachable vs. fixed arms
- Need must be patient's medical need, not caregiver convenience
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0163 (cannot use regular toilet due to confinement/mobility)
- **PLUS** detachable arms needed to facilitate transfers from bed/wheelchair, OR
- **PLUS** body configuration requires extra width access for safe transfers

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Same as E0163 (fiscal order, DVS authorization, medical necessity)
- **PLUS** document detachable arms medically necessary for safe transfers
- Specify transfer needs (e.g., slide board transfers, wheelchair transfers)
- Must be patient's medical need, NOT caregiver convenience
- Frequency: F3 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization REQUIRED before delivery
- Specific prescription: "E0165 commode with detachable arms"
- Must justify why E0163 (fixed arms) is inadequate
- Document transfer method requiring arm removal

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and authorization processes are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All E0163 requirements (patient demographics, ICD-10, confinement status)
- [ ] Specific code: "E0165 - Commode with detachable arms"
- [ ] Documentation of transfer needs requiring arm removal
- [ ] Description of transfer method (e.g., wheelchair to commode, slide board)
- [ ] Statement that detachable arms are medically necessary (not just convenient)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document patient meets E0163 confinement criteria
- [ ] Document transfer assistance need OR body width requirement
- [ ] Explain why fixed-arm commode (E0163) inadequate

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained before delivery
- [ ] Detailed transfer assessment
- [ ] Specific functional need for detachable arms
- [ ] Document patient safety requires arm removal for transfers

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Insufficient justification for detachable arms. Fix: Document specific transfer method requiring arm removal; include transfer assessment.

2. **"Standard commode adequate"** - Did not prove need for detachable feature. Fix: Clearly explain why fixed-arm commode (E0163) cannot be safely used for patient's transfers.

3. **"Caregiver convenience only"** - Appears to be for caregiver ease rather than patient medical need. Fix: Document patient's medical need (body width, transfer type) rather than caregiver preference.

4. **"Confinement criteria not met"** - Patient doesn't meet basic commode criteria. Fix: First establish E0163 criteria, then add detachable arm justification.

5. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before authorization. Fix: Supplier must wait for DVS approval.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- First establish patient meets E0163 confinement criteria
- Then document specific transfer need:
  - "Patient transfers from wheelchair to commode using slide board - requires arm removal for side transfer"
  - "Patient's body width (XX inches) requires extra access space; fixed arms prevent safe positioning"
- Include transfer assessment from PT/OT if available (not required but helpful)
- Use clear medical justification, not caregiver convenience

**Medicaid:**
- Everything from Medicare, plus:
- Specific prescription: "E0165 commode with detachable arms" - never generic
- DVS authorization must be obtained by supplier before delivery
- Detailed functional transfer assessment
- Document specific safety concerns with fixed-arm commode
- Explain transfer method in detail (wheelchair approach, slide board use, etc.)
- If body width is reason, include measurements

## Related Codes

- **E0163** - Commode with fixed arms - Use when patient does not require arm removal for transfers. Least costly alternative if detachable arms not medically necessary.

- **E0168** - Extra wide/heavy duty commode - Required for patients â‰¥300 lbs (Medicare) or >300 lbs (Medicaid). May have detachable arms feature included.

- **E0167** - Commode pail/pan replacement - Separately billable replacement accessory for any commode type.
