# E0161 - Sitz Bath with Faucet Attachment

## Clinical Overview

A portable sitz bath with faucet attachment provides therapeutic perineal soaking with the added feature of water temperature control via faucet. The faucet attachment allows continuous fresh water flow and temperature adjustment during treatment. This is prescribed when temperature regulation is therapeutically important for the patient's perineal condition.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0160 - perineal injury or infection requiring home sitz bath therapy
- Medical necessity for therapeutic perineal soaking
- Part of prescribed treatment regimen

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order (SWO) required before claim submission
- Physician prescription for home use
- Same documentation as E0160
- Proof of delivery mandatory

**Important Notes:**
- Coverage criteria same as E0160
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies
- Must be for therapeutic use as part of treatment plan

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0160 with additional faucet for water temperature control
- Post-surgical or infection treatment requiring therapeutic soaking
- Medical necessity for temperature control feature

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with medical necessity statement
- DVS authorization REQUIRED before delivery
- Verify code availability with NY Medicaid prior to ordering
- If covered, same criteria as E0160 PLUS justification for faucet feature
- Document why temperature control is medically necessary
- Frequency: F3 (once every 5 years)

**Important Notes:**
- **VERIFY CODE AVAILABILITY** - Check with NY Medicaid before prescribing
- May require additional justification for faucet feature vs. standard E0160
- Must obtain DVS authorization before delivery

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria same as Nassau County.** Verify code availability with NY Medicaid prior to ordering.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0161 - Sitz bath with faucet attachment"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for perineal condition
- [ ] Statement that sitz bath is part of prescribed treatment regimen
- [ ] Justification for faucet feature (temperature control need)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document perineal injury or infection
- [ ] Specify therapeutic use as part of treatment plan

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **VERIFY** code is active/covered by NY Medicaid before prescribing
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained by supplier before delivery
- [ ] Document medical necessity for temperature control feature
- [ ] Explain why standard sitz bath (E0160) is inadequate

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Code not covered"** (Medicaid) - Code may not be in NY Medicaid fee schedule. Fix: Verify code availability before prescribing; may need to use E0160 instead.

2. **"Not medically necessary"** - Insufficient justification for faucet feature. Fix: Document why temperature control is therapeutically important for patient's condition.

3. **"Least costly alternative"** - Could use E0160 instead. Fix: Provide clinical rationale for temperature control necessity.

4. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Delivered before authorization. Fix: Supplier must wait for DVS approval.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Same requirements as E0160
- Document therapeutic indication clearly
- Include sitz bath in treatment plan

**Medicaid:**
- **CRITICAL: Verify code availability** with NYRx (518) 486-3209 before prescribing
- If not available, use E0160 instead
- If available, provide detailed justification for faucet feature
- Explain therapeutic benefit of temperature control (e.g., alternating warm/cool for edema reduction)
- Document why standard sitz bath inadequate for patient's needs

## Related Codes

- **E0160** - Sitz bath, portable (without faucet) - May be least costly alternative if faucet feature not medically justified

- **E0162** - Sitz bath chair - Chair-style design for additional comfort/safety
