# E0167 - Commode Pail/Pan Replacement

## Clinical Overview

The E0167 is a replacement pail or pan for an existing covered commode chair. This is a replacement-only accessory and is not provided at initial commode issue (included with the chair). It is covered when the existing pail is damaged, worn, unsanitary, or no longer functional and the patient has a covered commode meeting medical necessity criteria.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Patient must have existing covered commode chair (E0163, E0165, E0168, E0170, E0171)
- Patient must still meet commode coverage criteria (confined to room/level/home without toilet)
- Replacement pail needed due to damage, wear, or unsanitary condition

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Standard Written Order required
- Proof of delivery required
- Must be replacement for existing covered commode
- Document reason for replacement
- Billed separately from commode chair

**Important Notes:**
- Replacement only - NOT provided with new commode (included in chair codes)
- Patient must still meet medical necessity for commode use
- Separately billable when existing pail needs replacement

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Replacement of worn/damaged pail for patient-owned commode chair
- Patient must have existing covered commode
- Pail is damaged, unsanitary, or non-functional

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order
- DVS authorization REQUIRED
- Must have existing commode chair on record
- Document replacement need (damaged, unsanitary, non-functional)
- Frequency: F3 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required before delivery
- Must verify patient has existing commode
- Document specific reason for replacement (not routine replacement)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** All requirements, documentation needs, and authorization processes are the same.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0167 - Commode pail/pan replacement"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) supporting ongoing commode need
- [ ] Statement that patient has existing commode
- [ ] Reason for replacement (damaged, worn, unsanitary, non-functional)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document patient still meets commode medical necessity criteria
- [ ] Specify reason pail needs replacement

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] DVS authorization must be obtained before delivery
- [ ] Verify patient has existing commode on record
- [ ] Document specific condition requiring replacement

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No existing commode on record"** - Patient doesn't have documented covered commode. Fix: Verify commode was previously approved; include commode authorization details if available.

2. **"Included in base"** - Billed with new commode at initial issue. Fix: E0167 is for replacement only; pail is included with commode codes at initial delivery.

3. **"Not medically necessary"** - Patient no longer meets commode criteria. Fix: Confirm patient still requires commode per original criteria; document ongoing medical necessity.

4. **"Frequency exceeded"** - Requested too soon after previous replacement. Fix: Verify frequency limits; provide justification if earlier replacement needed (damage, etc.).

5. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain DVS authorization before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Verify patient has existing covered commode
- Document patient still meets medical necessity for commode use
- Specify reason for replacement (damaged, worn out, unsanitary, cracked, etc.)
- Do NOT bill E0167 with new commode - pail is included in commode codes

**Medicaid:**
- DVS authorization required - supplier handles this
- Verify patient's existing commode is in NY Medicaid system
- Be specific about replacement reason:
  - "Pail is cracked and leaking"
  - "Pail is worn and unsanitary despite cleaning"
  - "Pail damaged and cannot be sanitized"
- Frequency is F3 (once every 3 years) - verify time since last pail
- Generic "needs replacement" is insufficient - be specific

## Related Codes

- **E0163** - Commode with fixed arms - Pail included at initial issue
- **E0165** - Commode with detachable arms - Pail included at initial issue
- **E0168** - Heavy duty commode - Pail included at initial issue
- **E0170/E0171** - Commode with seat lift - Pail included at initial issue

**Note:** E0167 is ONLY for replacing existing pail, NOT for initial commode setup.
