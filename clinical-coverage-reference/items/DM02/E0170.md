# E0170 - Electric Seat Lift Commode

## Clinical Overview

The E0170 is a commode chair with an integrated electric seat lift mechanism. This specialized equipment is for patients who meet BOTH commode coverage criteria (confined and cannot access regular toilet) AND seat lift criteria (cannot stand from chair). This is rarely covered due to conflicting requirements - patient must be confined enough to need commode but ambulatory enough after standing to not need commode in bedroom.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Must meet commode criteria per E0163 (confined to room/level/home without toilet), AND
- Must meet seat lift mechanism criteria per separate LCD:
  - Severe arthritis of hip or knee, OR
  - Severe neuromuscular disease, OR
  - Completely unable to stand from chair without seat lift
- Patient must be able to ambulate AFTER standing (with lift assistance)

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Detailed Written Order (DWO) required
- Must document BOTH sets of criteria:
  - Commode confinement documentation
  - Seat lift medical necessity documentation
- KX modifier ONLY if ALL criteria met
- **DO NOT use KX if patient is ambulatory to bathroom** (conflicts with confinement)

**Important Notes:**
- **RARELY COVERED** due to conflicting requirements:
  - If patient can ambulate after standing, why confined to room?
  - If patient is truly confined, why need seat lift to walk elsewhere?
- Both commode LCD and seat lift LCD criteria must be met
- Separate seat lift chairs (E0627/E0629) are under different LCD

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Requires commode (cannot access regular toilet), AND
- Meets seat lift criteria:
  - Severe arthritis limiting standing ability, OR
  - Neuromuscular disease preventing standing, OR
  - Completely unable to stand from chair without mechanical assistance

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with detailed medical necessity
- Prior approval REQUIRED if available (check with Medicaid)
- Must meet criteria for BOTH commode and seat lift (similar to E0627/E0629 seat lift chairs)
- Document all therapeutic modalities tried and failed for standing
- DVS authorization required
- Frequency: F3 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- Prior approval typically required
- Must justify need for BOTH features on same device
- Document conflicting needs carefully (confined but can ambulate after lift)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** Prior approval typically required; DVS authorization required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All E0163 requirements (confinement documentation)
- [ ] Specific code: "E0170 - Commode with electric seat lift"
- [ ] Documentation of seat lift medical necessity
- [ ] Diagnosis supporting both confinement AND standing difficulty
- [ ] Explanation of why both features needed
- [ ] Document therapeutic modalities tried for standing ability
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document patient meets commode confinement criteria
- [ ] Document patient meets seat lift criteria (arthritis, neuromuscular disease, or inability to stand)
- [ ] Explain apparent conflict (confined but ambulatory after standing)
- [ ] KX modifier only if truly ALL criteria met

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Prior approval required - supplier must obtain
- [ ] DVS authorization required
- [ ] Detailed justification for combination device
- [ ] Document failed trials of standard commode + other standing assistance

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Conflicting requirements"** - Patient ambulatory enough not to need commode, or confined enough not to benefit from seat lift. Fix: Carefully document specific scenario where both are needed.

2. **"Seat lift criteria not met"** - Insufficient documentation of standing difficulty. Fix: Document severe arthritis, neuromuscular disease, or complete inability to stand; include failed therapeutic modalities.

3. **"Commode criteria not met"** - If patient can walk to bathroom after standing, why need commode? Fix: Explain specific circumstances (e.g., nighttime toileting, distance too far even after standing).

4. **"Separate devices appropriate"** - Could use standard commode plus transfer assistance. Fix: Document why integrated device medically necessary vs. separate solutions.

5. **"Prior approval not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain prior approval before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Be aware this is rarely covered** due to conflicting criteria
- Best case scenario for approval:
  - Patient confined to one level (upstairs bedroom) without toilet on that level
  - Patient has severe arthritis/neuromuscular disease preventing standing
  - Patient CAN walk short distances once standing (e.g., to commode)
  - Cannot walk to distant bathroom but can walk few steps to bedside commode
- Document very carefully why BOTH features needed on same device
- Include detailed explanation of living situation and functional limitations
- Consider whether separate devices might be more appropriate

**Medicaid:**
- Prior approval almost certainly required
- Provide comprehensive justification for combination device
- Document failed trials:
  - Standard commode used but patient cannot stand from it
  - Tried grab bars, raised toilet seats - inadequate
  - Tried transfer assistance - inadequate or unavailable
- Explain why separate seat lift chair + standard commode won't work
- Very specific scenario needed for approval

## Related Codes

- **E0163** - Standard commode - More commonly covered; use when seat lift not needed

- **E0171** - Commode with non-electric seat lift - Same coverage challenges as E0170

- **E0627/E0629** - Seat lift chairs (patient-operated/electric) - Separate devices under different LCD; not commodes

- **E0165** - Commode with detachable arms - May facilitate transfers without seat lift
