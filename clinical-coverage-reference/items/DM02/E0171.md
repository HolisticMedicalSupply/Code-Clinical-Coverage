# E0171 - Manual/Non-Electric Seat Lift Commode

## Clinical Overview

The E0171 is a commode chair with an integrated manual (non-electric) seat lift mechanism. Like E0170, this requires the patient to meet BOTH commode criteria (confined, cannot access regular toilet) AND seat lift criteria (cannot stand from chair). The manual mechanism uses springs, pneumatic, or mechanical assistance rather than electric power. This is rarely covered due to the same conflicting requirements as E0170.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0170:
  - Must meet commode criteria (confined to room/level/home without toilet), AND
  - Must meet seat lift criteria (severe arthritis, neuromuscular disease, or complete inability to stand), AND
  - Patient must be able to ambulate after standing

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Same as E0170:
  - Detailed Written Order (DWO) required
  - Document BOTH commode and seat lift criteria
  - KX modifier only if ALL criteria met
  - Do NOT use KX if patient is ambulatory to bathroom

**Important Notes:**
- **RARELY COVERED** - same conflicting requirements as E0170
- Manual lift mechanism instead of electric
- Both commode LCD and seat lift LCD criteria must be met
- If patient can ambulate, questions arise about confinement need

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0170 with manual/non-electric lift mechanism
- Must meet both commode and seat lift criteria
- Requires seat lift for standing AND commode for toileting

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Same as E0170
- Physician fiscal order with detailed medical necessity
- Prior approval required if available
- Verify availability with NY Medicaid before ordering
- DVS authorization required
- Frequency: F3 (once every 3 years)

**Important Notes:**
- **VERIFY code availability** with NY Medicaid prior to ordering
- Same coverage challenges as E0170
- Manual mechanism may be viewed as requiring caregiver operation (vs. patient-operated electric)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County.** Verify availability with NY Medicaid prior to ordering. Prior approval required.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] All E0163 requirements (confinement documentation)
- [ ] Specific code: "E0171 - Commode with non-electric seat lift"
- [ ] Documentation of seat lift medical necessity
- [ ] Diagnosis supporting both confinement AND standing difficulty
- [ ] Explanation of why both features needed on same device
- [ ] Justification for non-electric vs. electric mechanism
- [ ] Document therapeutic modalities tried
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Same as E0170 requirements
- [ ] KX modifier only if truly all criteria met
- [ ] Explain conflicting ambulatory/confinement status

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **VERIFY** code is available before prescribing
- [ ] Prior approval required - supplier must obtain
- [ ] DVS authorization required
- [ ] May need to justify manual vs. electric mechanism

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Conflicting requirements"** - Same as E0170. Patient either ambulatory (doesn't need commode) or confined (doesn't need seat lift for ambulation).

2. **"Code not covered"** (Medicaid) - Code may not be in NY Medicaid fee schedule. Fix: Verify availability before prescribing.

3. **"Seat lift criteria not met"** - Insufficient documentation. Fix: Document severe arthritis, neuromuscular disease, or complete inability to stand.

4. **"Electric more appropriate"** - If patient needs seat lift, electric may be medically necessary. Fix: Justify manual mechanism (e.g., patient/caregiver can operate manually).

5. **"Prior approval not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain prior approval.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Same challenges as E0170** - rarely covered
- Best scenario: Patient confined to level without toilet, severe arthritis prevents standing, can walk short distance once standing
- Document very carefully why both features needed
- Justify manual mechanism:
  - Patient or caregiver can operate manual lift
  - Electric not necessary or contraindicated
- Consider whether separate devices (standard commode + grab bars/transfer pole) more appropriate

**Medicaid:**
- **CRITICAL: Verify code availability** - may not be in fee schedule
- Prior approval almost certainly required
- Provide comprehensive justification similar to E0170
- Additionally justify manual vs. electric:
  - Manual lift adequate for patient's weight/condition
  - Caregiver available to assist with manual mechanism if needed
  - Electric not medically necessary
- Document failed trials of alternatives

## Related Codes

- **E0170** - Commode with electric seat lift - Electric version; same coverage challenges

- **E0163** - Standard commode - More commonly covered; use when seat lift not needed

- **E0627/E0629** - Manual/electric seat lift chairs (not commodes) - Separate devices under different LCD

- **E0165** - Commode with detachable arms - May facilitate transfers without seat lift mechanism
