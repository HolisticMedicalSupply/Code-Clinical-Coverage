# E0162 - Sitz Bath Chair

## Clinical Overview

A sitz bath chair is a chair-style design for therapeutic perineal soaking. The chair design provides additional comfort and safety during perineal therapy, particularly for patients with mobility limitations or those who require more stable seating during treatment. This design allows for therapeutic soaking while seated in a more supportive configuration.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0160 and E0161 - perineal injury or infection requiring sitz bath therapy at home
- Medical necessity for therapeutic perineal soaking
- Part of prescribed treatment regimen

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician prescription/order required
- Standard Written Order before claim submission
- Proof of delivery required
- Documentation of perineal condition requiring therapeutic soaking

**Important Notes:**
- Coverage criteria same as other sitz baths (E0160, E0161)
- Chair design provides additional comfort/safety
- 5-year reasonable useful lifetime applies

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as E0160 with chair-style design for patient comfort/safety during perineal therapy
- Medical necessity for therapeutic soaking
- May require justification for chair design vs. standard sitz bath

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Physician fiscal order with medical necessity statement
- Verify code availability with NY Medicaid prior to ordering
- May require prior approval if not in standard fee schedule
- DVS authorization likely required
- Document why chair design is medically necessary

**Important Notes:**
- **VERIFY CODE AVAILABILITY** before prescribing
- May need to justify chair design over standard sitz bath
- Document patient's mobility limitations or safety needs if applicable

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria same as Nassau County.** Verify code availability and obtain prior approval as needed.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "E0162 - Sitz bath chair"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code(s) for perineal condition
- [ ] Statement that sitz bath is part of prescribed treatment regimen
- [ ] Justification for chair design (comfort/safety/mobility needs)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Document perineal injury or infection
- [ ] Specify therapeutic use as part of treatment plan

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] **VERIFY** code is active/covered by NY Medicaid before prescribing
- [ ] Supplier must obtain prior approval if required
- [ ] DVS authorization likely needed
- [ ] Document why chair design is medically necessary vs. standard sitz bath

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Code not covered"** (Medicaid) - Code may not be in fee schedule. Fix: Verify availability; may need to use E0160 instead.

2. **"Not medically necessary"** - Insufficient justification for chair design. Fix: Document patient's mobility limitations or safety needs requiring chair configuration.

3. **"Least costly alternative"** - Could use E0160 instead. Fix: Provide clinical rationale for chair design (mobility issues, balance problems, etc.).

4. **"Prior approval not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Supplier must obtain prior approval before delivery.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Same requirements as standard sitz baths
- Document therapeutic indication for perineal soaking
- Chair design typically does not require additional justification

**Medicaid:**
- **CRITICAL: Verify code availability** before prescribing
- If not available, use E0160 as alternative
- If available, document why chair design is medically necessary
- Include mobility assessment if patient has difficulty using standard sitz bath
- Document safety concerns that chair design addresses (balance issues, transfer difficulties, etc.)

## Related Codes

- **E0160** - Sitz bath, portable - Standard model without chair design; may be least costly alternative

- **E0161** - Sitz bath with faucet - Includes temperature control feature
