# E0197 - Air Pressure Pad/Overlay (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0197 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - an air pressure pad/overlay that sits **ON TOP** of an existing mattress. More cost-effective than full mattress replacement (E0186 air mattress) when existing mattress adequate but needs additional pressure redistribution. Air provides adjustable pressure redistribution.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Overlay/pad** - sits on top of existing mattress (vs. E0186 full mattress replacement)
- **Air-filled** - adjustable pressure redistribution
- **Standard mattress length and width**
- Cost-effective alternative to full mattress replacement

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery)**
- **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months
- **Immobile patient**
- **Any stage pressure ulcer** on trunk/pelvis
- **At least one risk factor:** malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation
- **Comprehensive care plan**
- **No bottoming out** - air pad provides adequate pressure redistribution

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (GROUP 1 device)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization required**
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days
- Same clinical documentation as Medicare
- Air pad adequate without bottoming out

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0197 - Air pressure pad for mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx)
- [ ] **Immobile patient** documented
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer** documentation (location, stage, measurements)
- [ ] **Risk factors (≥1):** malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam**
- [ ] **Comprehensive care plan**
- [ ] **No bottoming out** documented
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Tips for Prescribers

**Overlay (E0197) vs. Full Mattress (E0186):**
- **Use E0197 (overlay)** when existing mattress adequate, just needs additional layer
- **Use E0186 (full mattress)** when existing mattress inadequate/worn
- E0197 more cost-effective
