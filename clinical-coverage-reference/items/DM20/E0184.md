# E0184 - Dry Pressure Redistribution Mattress (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0184 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a dry pressure mattress that uses foam, fiber, or other dry materials to provide static pressure redistribution. Unlike powered alternating pressure systems (E0181/E0183) or fluid-filled mattresses (E0186 air, E0187 water, E0196 gel), this is a **static surface** with no moving parts, pump, or fluid components. Simple, reliable, and straightforward coverage with no prior authorization required.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Dry materials** - foam, fiber, or other dry materials (not air, water, gel)
- **Static pressure redistribution** - no pump, no powered components
- **Full mattress replacement** - replaces entire standard mattress
- Reliable, low-maintenance option

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with immobility (bed-bound or limited mobility)
- Any stage pressure ulcer (Stage 1-4) on trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock, heel)
- At least one risk factor: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
- GROUP 1 device - first-line therapy for pressure ulcer management

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0184 - Dry pressure mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx pressure ulcer)
- [ ] **Immobility status:**
  - [ ] Bed-bound (cannot get out of bed independently) OR
  - [ ] Limited mobility (requires assistance, spends majority of day in bed/chair)
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer documentation:**
  - [ ] Location: trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock) or heel
  - [ ] Stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable, or deep tissue injury
  - [ ] Size measurements (length x width x depth)
  - [ ] Appearance (color, drainage, necrotic tissue, etc.)
- [ ] **Risk factors (document ≥1):**
  - [ ] Malnutrition (albumin levels, BMI, nutritional assessment, poor intake)
  - [ ] Incontinence (urinary, fecal, or both - frequency, management)
  - [ ] Altered sensation (neuropathy, spinal cord injury, decreased sensation to touch/pain)
  - [ ] Compromised circulation (peripheral vascular disease, edema, poor perfusion, capillary refill)
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months documented
- [ ] **Comprehensive pressure ulcer management program:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning schedule (frequency: every 2 hours typical, technique, documentation)
  - [ ] Wound care protocol (dressings, debridement, cleansing, frequency)
  - [ ] Nutritional interventions (calorie/protein goals, supplements, tube feeding if needed)
  - [ ] Incontinence management (toileting schedule, barrier creams, catheter if applicable)
- [ ] **No bottoming out:** Document mattress provides adequate pressure redistribution - patient does not compress mattress to bed frame (hand check under pressure points shows gap)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No documented pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis"** - Location requirement. Fix: Document pressure ulcer location specifically (sacrum, hip, buttock, heel, other trunk/pelvis). If ulcer only on extremity (arm, leg), GROUP 1 mattress may not be appropriate - consider positioning devices instead.

2. **"No risk factors documented"** - Coverage requires at least one risk factor. Fix: Document at least one risk factor with objective data: malnutrition (albumin <3.5 g/dL, BMI <18.5, poor oral intake), incontinence (frequency, type, duration), altered sensation (monofilament testing, sensory exam), compromised circulation (ABI <0.9, edema, poor capillary refill >2 seconds).

3. **"Comprehensive management program not documented"** - Treatment program required. Fix: Document complete program including specific turning schedule (every 2 hours: supine → right lateral → prone → left lateral, pillows between knees), wound care protocol (specific dressings, frequency, cleansing), nutritional interventions (1800 calories, 80g protein, Boost TID), incontinence management (scheduled toileting q2h, barrier cream, brief changes).

4. **"No face-to-face exam within 6 months"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: Document face-to-face exam within 6 months of order. Include pressure ulcer assessment, mobility evaluation, skin inspection over bony prominences, risk factor assessment.

5. **"Patient bottoming out on mattress"** - Inadequate pressure redistribution. Fix: Document mattress provides adequate pressure redistribution - hand check under sacrum/heels shows gap between patient and bed frame, no full compression. If patient too heavy/large and bottoms out on standard dry mattress, may need alternative (air mattress E0186, gel mattress E0196, or powered system E0181).

6. **"Immobility not documented"** - Coverage requires immobility. Fix: Document patient bed-bound (cannot get out of bed without assistance, spends 20-24 hours/day in bed) OR limited mobility (requires assist for all transfers, spends >18 hours/day in bed/recliner). Include functional assessment.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- GROUP 1 device - **no PA required**, straightforward coverage
- **Any stage** pressure ulcer qualifies (Stage 1 through 4)
- At least **one risk factor** must be documented
- Comprehensive management program is **required** - not optional

**Medicaid:**
- **DVS authorization required** - submit through DVS system
- **10-month rental limit** - plan accordingly
- Same documentation requirements as Medicare
- Monthly rental billing

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Take photos of pressure ulcer (include ruler for scale)
- Measure precisely (length x width x depth in cm)
- Document risk factors with objective data (lab values, specific measurements)
- Create comprehensive management plan **before** ordering device
- Use Braden Scale or similar risk assessment tool (score <18 = high risk)

**Device Selection - Dry vs. Other Mattresses:**

**Use DRY MATTRESS (E0184) if:**
- Patient/caregiver prefers low-maintenance option
- No access to electricity required
- Quiet environment needed (no pump noise)
- Reliable static pressure redistribution sufficient
- Cost-effectiveness priority

**Consider alternatives if:**
- **Powered alternating pressure (E0181):** Patient needs dynamic pressure relief, has multiple/worsening ulcers
- **Air mattress (E0186):** Patient needs adjustable pressure, has fluctuating weight/condition
- **Gel mattress (E0196):** Patient has excessive heat intolerance, needs cooling properties
- **Water mattress (E0187):** Patient needs fluid-based pressure redistribution (less common due to weight)

**Advantages of Dry Mattress:**
- No electricity required
- No pump noise
- No maintenance (no air leaks, fluid levels)
- Lightweight compared to water
- Reliable, simple to use
- Often more cost-effective

**Disadvantages:**
- Static only (no dynamic pressure changes)
- May compress over time (check for bottoming out periodically)
- Cannot adjust firmness
- May not be adequate for severe/multiple ulcers
