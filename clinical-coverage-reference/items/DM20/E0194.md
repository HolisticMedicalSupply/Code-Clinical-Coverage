# E0194 - Air-Fluidized Bed (GROUP 3 - Most Restrictive)

## ðŸš¨ MEDICARE: PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED | NY MEDICAID: NOT COVERED FOR HOME

## Clinical Overview

E0194 is a **GROUP 3 support surface** - the **most restrictive** pressure ulcer management device. Air-fluidized beds use forced air through ceramic beads creating fluid-like support. Reserved for most severe cases: completely immobile patients with altered sensory perception AND Stage 3-4 ulcers who have **failed GROUP 2 trial**. 

**CRITICAL:** **NY Medicaid does NOT cover for home setting** - institutional settings only

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 3** - MOST RESTRICTIVE device
- **Air-fluidized** - forced air through ceramic beads creates fluid-like support
- **Medicare:** PA required, face-to-face within 1 WEEK, recertification EVERY 30 DAYS
- **NY Medicaid:** **NOT COVERED for home DME**

**Stringent Requirements:**
- Completely immobile + altered sensory perception
- Stage 3-4 trunk/pelvis ulcer
- **Failed GROUP 2 trial** (GROUP 1 failure insufficient)
- Would require institutionalization without bed
- Caregiver available
- Close medical supervision

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes with Prior Approval (most restrictive requirements)

**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **Face-to-face within 1 WEEK prior to initiation** (not 6 months)
- **Failed GROUP 2 trial documented**
- **Complete immobility** (bedridden/chair-bound)
- **Altered sensory perception**
- **Stage 3-4 pressure ulcer** trunk/pelvis
- Would require institutionalization without bed
- Caregiver available for home management
- Comprehensive evaluation:
  - Turning/positioning attempted
  - Wound care
  - Moisture/incontinence management
  - Nutritional assessment
- **Physician re-evaluation/recertification EVERY 30 DAYS**

**Important:** Monthly physician recertification required - ongoing intensive monitoring

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**NOT COVERED for home setting** per DME manual

**May be covered in institutional settings only**
- Contact NY Medicaid institutional billing for facility coverage
- Not available for home DME

**Important:** Do NOT order E0194 for Medicaid home patients - will be denied

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- Most restrictive device - reserve for most severe cases only
- **Face-to-face within 1 WEEK** (not 6 months like GROUP 1/2)
- Must document **failed GROUP 2 trial** (GROUP 1 failure alone insufficient)
- **Monthly recertification** burden - ongoing physician assessments required
- Institutionalization criterion: patient would require facility placement without bed

**Medicaid:**
- **DO NOT ORDER for home patients** - NOT COVERED
- May be covered in institutional settings (hospitals, nursing facilities)
- For home Medicaid patients with severe ulcers: maximize GROUP 2 devices instead

**Device Hierarchy:**
- **GROUP 1:** Basic support surfaces (E0181, E0184, E0186, etc.)
- **GROUP 2:** Advanced support surfaces (E0277, E0371, E0372, E0373) - require failed GROUP 1
- **GROUP 3:** Air-fluidized bed (E0194) - require failed GROUP 2

## Related Codes

- **E0193** - Powered air flotation bed (low air loss therapy). Advanced device but GROUP 1/2 level, not GROUP 3. See DM20 category.
- **E0277** - Powered pressure-reducing air mattress (GROUP 2). Try before E0194. See DM20 category.
