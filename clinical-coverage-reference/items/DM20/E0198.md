# E0198 - Water Pressure Pad/Overlay (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0198 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a water pressure pad/overlay that sits **ON TOP** of an existing mattress. More cost-effective than full water mattress replacement (E0187) when existing mattress adequate. Water provides conforming support but is **heavier** than other overlay options - verify bed frame can support additional weight.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Overlay/pad** - sits on top of existing mattress (vs. E0187 full mattress replacement)
- **Water-filled** - conforming pressure redistribution
- **Heavier than other overlays** - verify bed frame weight capacity
- Cost-effective alternative to full mattress replacement

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD**
- **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months
- **Complete or limited mobility**
- **Any stage pressure ulcer** on trunk/pelvis
- **Risk factors present**
- **Comprehensive treatment plan**
- **Bed frame can support additional water weight**

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (GROUP 1 device)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization required**
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days
- Same clinical documentation as Medicare
- Bed frame weight capacity adequate

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0198 - Water pressure pad for mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx)
- [ ] **Mobility:** complete or limited mobility
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer** documentation
- [ ] **Risk factors** present
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam**
- [ ] **Comprehensive treatment plan**
- [ ] **Bed frame weight capacity** adequate for water pad
- [ ] **Why water overlay** vs. lighter alternatives (air, foam, gel)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Tips for Prescribers

**Overlay (E0198) vs. Full Mattress (E0187):**
- **Use E0198 (overlay)** when existing mattress adequate
- **Use E0187 (full mattress)** when mattress needs replacement
- E0198 more cost-effective

**Weight Consideration:**
- Water overlays heavier than foam/air/gel options
- Verify bed frame can support additional weight
- Usually prefer lighter alternatives unless specific clinical indication for water

## Related Codes

- **E0185** - Gel pressure pad (GROUP 1). Gel overlay, lighter than water. See DM20 category.
- **E0197** - Air pressure pad (GROUP 1). Air overlay, much lighter than water. See DM20 category.
- **E0199** - Dry pressure pad (GROUP 1). Foam overlay, lightest option. See DM20 category.
