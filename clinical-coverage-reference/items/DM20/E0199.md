# E0199 - Dry Pressure Pad/Overlay (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0199 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a dry pressure pad/overlay (foam or fiber) that sits **ON TOP** of an existing mattress. Most cost-effective overlay option - simpler and lighter than air/water/gel alternatives. More economical than full dry mattress replacement (E0184) when existing mattress adequate.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Overlay/pad** - sits on top of existing mattress (vs. E0184 full mattress replacement)
- **Foam or fiber material** - dry, static pressure redistribution
- **≥3 inches height** required for adequate pressure redistribution
- **Lightweight, low maintenance** - simplest overlay option
- Cost-effective

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD**
- **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months
- **Immobile patient**
- **Any stage pressure ulcer** on trunk/pelvis
- **At least one risk factor:** malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
- **Comprehensive ulcer care plan**

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (GROUP 1 device)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **DVS authorization required**
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days
- Same clinical documentation as Medicare
- **Overlay provides ≥3 inches height and prevents bottoming out** (must document)

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0199 - Dry pressure pad for mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx)
- [ ] **Immobile patient** documented
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer** documentation (location, stage, measurements)
- [ ] **Risk factors (≥1):** malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam**
- [ ] **Comprehensive ulcer care plan**
- [ ] **Overlay specifications:**
  - [ ] ≥3 inches height (thickness)
  - [ ] Prevents bottoming out (adequate pressure redistribution)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Tips for Prescribers

**Overlay (E0199) vs. Full Mattress (E0184):**
- **Use E0199 (overlay)** when existing mattress adequate, just needs additional foam layer
- **Use E0184 (full mattress)** when existing mattress worn/inadequate, needs complete replacement
- E0199 most cost-effective option

**E0199 (Dry/Foam) vs. Other Overlays:**
- **E0199 (dry/foam):** Simplest, lightest, lowest maintenance, most cost-effective
- **E0197 (air):** Adjustable firmness, may leak, requires inflation monitoring
- **E0185 (gel):** Cooling properties, heavier, more expensive
- **E0198 (water):** Conforming but heavy, leak risk

**3-Inch Height Requirement:**
- Medicaid requires ≥3 inches thickness
- Document overlay height/thickness
- Verify adequate pressure redistribution (no bottoming out)
