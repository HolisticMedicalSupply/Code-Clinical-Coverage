# E0187 - Water Pressure Redistribution Mattress (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0187 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a water pressure mattress that uses fluid-filled chambers for conforming pressure redistribution. Water provides excellent pressure distribution by conforming precisely to body contours. However, water mattresses are significantly **heavier** than foam, air, or gel alternatives, requiring adequate bed frame weight capacity.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Water-filled chambers** - fluid-based conforming support
- **Excellent pressure distribution** - water conforms precisely to body contours
- **Full mattress replacement** - replaces entire standard mattress
- **Heavy** - requires bed frame with adequate weight capacity (typically 150-300+ lbs for mattress alone)

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with complete or limited mobility
- Any stage pressure ulcer (Stage 1-4) on trunk/pelvis
- Risk factors present: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
- Bed frame with adequate weight capacity
- Less common than foam/air/gel due to weight considerations

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery)** including:
  - Complete or limited mobility documented
  - Any stage pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis (location, stage, size)
  - Risk factors documented: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
  - **Bed frame weight capacity adequate for water mattress**
- **Face-to-face exam within 6 months** documenting:
  - Pressure ulcer assessment
  - Mobility status
  - Risk factors
  - Skin integrity
- **Comprehensive ulcer treatment program:**
  - Turning and positioning schedule
  - Wound care protocol
  - Nutritional interventions
  - Incontinence management
- **No bottoming out** - patient must not compress mattress fully

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (GROUP 1 device)

**Important Notes:**
- GROUP 1 device - straightforward coverage
- **Weight consideration:** Water mattresses typically 150-300+ lbs when filled - verify bed frame capacity
- Any stage pressure ulcer qualifies
- Must have risk factors documented

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **DVS (Dispensing Validation System) authorization required**
- **Rental up to 10 months**

  - Any stage pressure ulcer trunk/pelvis
  - Risk factors
  - Comprehensive treatment program
  - Patient does not bottom out
  - **Bed frame weight capacity adequate**

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required
- 10-month rental limit
- Monthly rental billing
- Weight capacity verification critical

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0187 - Water pressure mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx)
- [ ] **Mobility status:**
  - [ ] Complete immobility (bed-bound) OR
  - [ ] Limited mobility (requires assistance)
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer documentation:**
  - [ ] Location: trunk/pelvis
  - [ ] Stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable, or DTI
  - [ ] Measurements
- [ ] **Risk factors (â‰¥1):**
  - [ ] Malnutrition
  - [ ] Incontinence
  - [ ] Altered sensation
  - [ ] Compromised circulation
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months
- [ ] **Comprehensive treatment program:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning
  - [ ] Wound care
  - [ ] Nutrition
  - [ ] Incontinence management
- [ ] **No bottoming out** documented
- [ ] **BED FRAME WEIGHT CAPACITY:**
  - [ ] Bed frame type/model
  - [ ] Weight capacity rating (must exceed patient weight + mattress weight ~150-300 lbs)
  - [ ] Verification that frame adequate for water mattress
- [ ] **Justification for water mattress:**
  - [ ] Why water vs. lighter alternatives (air, foam, gel)
  - [ ] Clinical benefit of fluid-based conforming support
  - [ ] Home setup accommodates weight
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Bed frame weight capacity not documented"** - Safety concern. Fix: Document bed frame type, model, weight capacity rating. Verify capacity exceeds patient weight + water mattress weight (typically 150-300+ lbs). If inadequate frame, recommend lighter alternative (air E0186, foam E0184, gel E0196) or frame upgrade before water mattress.

2. **"No justification for water vs. lighter alternatives"** - Payer may question selection. Fix: Document rationale: "Patient requires superior conforming support - previous foam mattress showed pressure points despite proper positioning" or "Patient skin integrity fragile - water provides optimal pressure distribution without shear" or "Patient tried air mattress but found motion uncomfortable - water stability preferred."

3. **"No risk factors documented"** - Coverage requires risk factors. Fix: Document at least one with objective data: malnutrition (albumin, BMI), incontinence (frequency), altered sensation (testing), compromised circulation (ABI, perfusion).

4. **"Comprehensive treatment program not documented"** - Required for GROUP 1. Fix: Document complete plan: turning schedule, wound care protocol, nutritional interventions, incontinence management with specific details.

5. **"Patient bottoming out on mattress"** - Inadequate pressure redistribution. Fix: Document adequate fluid level - hand check shows gap between patient and bed frame. If bottoming out, may need refill or alternative device.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Weight Considerations (CRITICAL):**
- Water mattresses typically **150-300+ pounds when filled**
- Verify bed frame weight capacity BEFORE ordering
- Total load = patient weight + mattress weight
- Standard residential bed frames may be inadequate
- Hospital beds usually adequate but verify
- If frame inadequate: recommend lighter alternative OR frame replacement/reinforcement

**Device Selection - Water vs. Other Mattresses:**

**Use WATER MATTRESS (E0187) ONLY if:**
- Bed frame has adequate weight capacity
- Patient/caregiver can handle weight for setup/maintenance
- Superior conforming support clinically indicated
- Patient unable to tolerate air sensation
- Home setup supports heavy mattress

**Usually prefer alternatives:**
- **Air mattress (E0186):** Much lighter, adjustable firmness
- **Foam mattress (E0184):** Lightest, no maintenance
- **Gel mattress (E0196):** Lighter than water, cooling properties

**Advantages of Water Mattress:**
- **Excellent conforming support** - water precisely matches body contours
- **Even pressure distribution**
- **Stable surface** - no air movement sensation
- Durable (no air leaks)

**Disadvantages:**
- **HEAVY** (150-300+ lbs) - limits portability, requires adequate frame
- Difficult setup/removal
- Potential for **leaks/spills** (water damage risk)
- **Temperature:** Water may feel cold initially (some have heaters)
- Motion transfer (wave effect)
- Less common/available than other options

**Medicare/Medicaid:**
- GROUP 1 device - **no PA for Medicare**
- **DVS authorization for Medicaid**
- Same documentation as other GROUP 1 devices
- **Weight capacity verification essential**

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Take photos of pressure ulcer
- Measure precisely
- Document risk factors with objective data
- **Document bed frame specifications** (critical for water mattress)
- Document rationale for water vs. lighter alternatives
- Create comprehensive care plan
