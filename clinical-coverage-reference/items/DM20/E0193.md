# E0193 - Low Air Loss Therapy Bed (Advanced Support Surface)

## ðŸš¨ PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED (Medicare & Medicaid)

## Clinical Overview

E0193 is an **advanced support surface** - a powered air flotation bed with low air loss therapy. Unlike basic GROUP 1 devices, low air loss beds provide continuous airflow through a microporous cover, actively reducing heat and moisture buildup while providing dynamic pressure redistribution. This device is reserved for complex pressure ulcers that have **failed GROUP 1 therapy** or severe Stage 3-4 ulcers requiring advanced management.

**Key Features:**
- **PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED** - both Medicare & Medicaid
- **Low air loss therapy** - continuous airflow through cover reduces heat/moisture
- **Powered air flotation** - dynamic pressure redistribution
- **Advanced support surface** - between GROUP 1 and GROUP 2 in hierarchy
- Requires **failed 30-day GROUP 1 trial** (or Stage 3-4 ulcers, or post-surgical)

**Three Pathways to Coverage:**
1. **Multiple Stage 2 ulcers** failed GROUP 1 for 30+ days (with documented progression)
2. **Large or multiple Stage 3-4 ulcers** on trunk/pelvis
3. **Post-myocutaneous flap or skin graft** within 60 days for pressure ulcer treatment

## Coverage Details

  **PATHWAY 1: Multiple Stage 2 Ulcers - Failed GROUP 1 Trial**
  - [ ] Multiple Stage 2 pressure ulcers on trunk/pelvis
  - [ ] Failed GROUP 1 support surface for 30+ days
  - [ ] Serial wound measurements showing no improvement OR worsening
  - [ ] GROUP 1 device used appropriately (compliance, proper setup, functioning device)
  - [ ] Wound measurements documented at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks (minimum)

  **PATHWAY 2: Large/Multiple Stage 3-4 Ulcers**
  - [ ] Large Stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcer(s) on trunk/pelvis OR
  - [ ] Multiple Stage 3 or 4 pressure ulcers on trunk/pelvis
  - [ ] Wound measurements (length x width x depth)
  - [ ] Ulcer complexity requiring advanced support immediately

  **PATHWAY 3: Post-Surgical Flap/Graft**
  - [ ] Myocutaneous flap or skin graft surgery for pressure ulcer treatment
  - [ ] Within 60 days post-surgery
  - [ ] Surgical documentation
  - [ ] Wound healing support required

- **Comprehensive care plan with regular RN/MD assessments:**

  - Turning/positioning protocol
  - Wound care regimen
  - Nutritional support plan
  - Incontinence management
  - Regular physician monitoring

**Rental Period:** Limited to healing period or 60 days post-surgery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- PA required **before** delivery

- **Wound DEPTH mandatory** for Medicaid (not just length x width)
- Time-limited authorization (healing or 60 days post-op)
- Both PA and DVS required
- May require recertification if healing takes longer than initial authorization

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Determine Clinical Pathway:**
- [ ] Which pathway applies to this patient?
  - [ ] Pathway 1: Multiple Stage 2 ulcers failed GROUP 1 for 30+ days
  - [ ] Pathway 2: Large/multiple Stage 3-4 ulcers
  - [ ] Pathway 3: Post-flap/graft within 60 days

**PATHWAY 1 Specific (Failed GROUP 1 Trial):**
- [ ] **GROUP 1 device documentation:**
  - [ ] Device type used (E0181, E0183, etc.)
  - [ ] Start date of GROUP 1 trial
  - [ ] Duration of use (minimum 30 days)
  - [ ] Compliance documented (patient using appropriately)
  - [ ] Device functioning properly (not malfunctioning)
- [ ] **Serial wound measurements (minimum 3 time points):**
  - [ ] Baseline (start of GROUP 1): Location, stage, length, width, depth
  - [ ] 2-week assessment: Measurements, status (improved/unchanged/worse)
  - [ ] 4-week assessment: Measurements, status
  - [ ] **For Medicaid: Depth measurements MANDATORY at each time point**
- [ ] **Documentation of no improvement or worsening:**
  - [ ] Measurements show no reduction in size/depth OR
  - [ ] Measurements show increase in size/depth OR
  - [ ] Stage progression (Stage 1â†’2, Stage 2â†’3)
- [ ] Multiple Stage 2 ulcers present

**PATHWAY 2 Specific (Large/Multiple Stage 3-4):**
- [ ] **Wound documentation:**
  - [ ] Location(s): Sacrum, hip, buttock, other trunk/pelvis
  - [ ] Stage: 3 or 4 for each ulcer
  - [ ] Measurements: Length x width x depth for each ulcer
  - [ ] **For Medicaid: Depth measurements MANDATORY**

  - [ ] Low air loss reduces moisture/heat affecting surgical site

- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"GROUP 1 trial not documented for 30 days"** - Pathway 1 requires trial. Fix: Document GROUP 1 device (E0181, E0183, etc.) used for minimum 30 days with serial measurements. Provide device start date, compliance documentation, measurements at baseline/2 weeks/4 weeks showing no improvement or worsening.

2. **"Wound measurements do not show GROUP 1 failure"** - Measurements show improvement. Fix: For Pathway 1, measurements must show NO improvement (same size) OR worsening (increased size/depth, stage progression). If ulcers improving on GROUP 1, continue GROUP 1 therapy. E0193 only covered if GROUP 1 inadequate.

3. **"Ulcers not Stage 2-4"** - Stage 1 does not qualify. Fix: E0193 requires Stage 2-4 ulcers. Document accurate staging per NPUAP/EPUAP guidelines. Stage 1 (non-blanchable erythema) managed with GROUP 1 devices. If Stage 1, use E0181/E0183 (GROUP 1).

4. **"Medicaid: No wound depth measurements"** - NY-specific requirement. Fix: Medicaid requires depth measurements (in cm or mm) at each assessment time point. Measure using sterile swab/probe to deepest point. Document depth alongside length and width.

5. **"No serial measurements - only single time point"** - Trial failure requires progression. Fix: Provide minimum 3 measurement time points over 30+ days: baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks (or more frequent). Show trend: unchanged or worsening measurements documenting GROUP 1 failure.

6. **"Comprehensive care plan not documented"** - Advanced device requires intensive management. Fix: Document complete care plan including regular wound assessments (frequency), turning protocol, wound care regimen, nutritional support (goals, interventions), incontinence management, regular physician monitoring (schedule, parameters).

7. **"Post-surgical but >60 days"** - Pathway 3 time limit. Fix: Flap/graft surgery must be within 60 days of E0193 order. Provide surgery date and current date showing <60 day interval. If >60 days, must qualify under Pathway 1 or 2 instead.

8. **"GROUP 1 device not used appropriately"** - Non-compliance or malfunction. Fix: Document patient compliance with GROUP 1 device (used nightly, proper setup), device functioning properly (pump cycling, adequate pressure). If non-compliant or device malfunctioning, GROUP 1 "trial" invalid - address compliance/repair before requesting E0193.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **PA required BEFORE delivery** - plan ahead (PA process takes time)
- **Serial measurements critical** for Pathway 1 - measure every 2 weeks minimum during GROUP 1 trial
- **Photo documentation** extremely helpful (include ruler for scale)
- Regular RN/physician assessments required - establish monitoring schedule upfront

**Medicaid:**
- **Wound DEPTH mandatory** - always measure and document depth (NY-specific)
- **Time-limited authorization** - healing period or 60 days post-op
- Both PA and DVS required - longer approval process
- May need recertification if healing extends beyond initial authorization

**Pathway Selection:**
- **Pathway 1** (failed GROUP 1): Most common, requires 30-day trial documentation
- **Pathway 2** (Stage 3-4): For immediate advanced support without GROUP 1 trial
- **Pathway 3** (post-surgical): Time-limited (60 days), surgical documentation required

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Serial measurements:** Use consistent measuring technique, same observer when possible, photo with ruler
- **GROUP 1 compliance:** Document patient education, nightly use logs, family/caregiver confirmation
- **Wound depth:** Use sterile technique, measure to deepest point, document in cm
- **Care plan:** Be specific (not "turning q2h" but "turning every 2 hours: supine â†’ right lateral â†’ prone â†’ left lateral sequence, pillows between knees, heels floating")
- **Regular assessments:** Establish schedule (weekly RN assessment, physician assessment every 2 weeks), document findings each visit

**Avoid Common Pitfalls:**
- Don't request E0193 without GROUP 1 trial unless Stage 3-4 or post-surgical
- Don't provide single wound measurement - serial measurements required
- Don't forget depth measurements for Medicaid
- Don't skip comprehensive care plan documentation
- Don't forget regular RN/MD assessment documentation
