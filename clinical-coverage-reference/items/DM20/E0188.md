# E0188 - Synthetic Sheepskin Comfort Pad

## Clinical Overview

E0188 is a synthetic sheepskin pad used for **friction and shear reduction** in patients with mobility limitations who are at risk for or have early-stage pressure injuries. This is a **basic comfort/prevention device** - simpler coverage than GROUP 1 support surfaces, generally direct bill with just a written order required.

**Key Features:**
- **Friction and shear reduction** - soft surface reduces skin friction
- **Comfort padding** - additional cushioning layer
- **Synthetic material** - washable, durable vs. natural lambswool
- **Prevention focus** - for at-risk patients and early-stage pressure injuries
- **Simple coverage** - Medicare generally direct bill, Medicaid direct bill (no PA typically)

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with mobility limitations (bed-bound, chair-bound)
- At risk for pressure ulcers (Braden Scale, risk factors)
- Early-stage pressure injury (Stage 1, superficial)
- Need for friction/shear reduction
- Comfort enhancement

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - generally direct bill

**Requirements:**
- **Written order** documented
- **Mobility limitations** with risk for or with early-stage pressure injury
- **Clinical indication:** Friction/shear reduction, pressure ulcer prevention/management
- **Face-to-face exam** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required - generally direct bill

**Important Notes:**
- Simpler coverage than GROUP 1 support surfaces
- Direct bill - no complex PA process
- For prevention and early-stage management
- Synthetic (vs. E0189 natural lambswool)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes - direct bill item

**Requirements:**
- **Direct bill** - no prior authorization typically required
- **Fiscal order** documented
- **Mobility limitations** with pressure ulcer risk
- **Face-to-face exam** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- No PA typically required
- Direct bill process
- Simpler than GROUP 1 devices

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0188 - Synthetic sheepskin pad"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx pressure ulcer or M62.3 immobility)
- [ ] **Mobility limitations:**
  - [ ] Bed-bound, chair-bound, or limited mobility
  - [ ] Pressure ulcer risk factors
- [ ] **Clinical indication:**
  - [ ] At risk for pressure ulcers (Braden Scale <18) OR
  - [ ] Early-stage pressure injury (Stage 1, superficial) OR
  - [ ] Friction/shear reduction needed
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Written order with diagnosis
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Tips for Prescribers

**E0188 (Synthetic) vs. E0189 (Lambswool):**
- **E0188 synthetic:** More durable, washable, typically less expensive
- **E0189 lambswool:** Natural material, may be softer/more comfortable for some patients
- Both serve same clinical purpose - friction/shear reduction

**Coverage:**
- **Medicare:** Generally direct bill - simple process
- **Medicaid:** Direct bill, no PA typically - straightforward

**Clinical Use:**
- **Prevention:** At-risk patients (immobility, risk factors)
- **Early management:** Stage 1, superficial injuries
- **Adjunct:** Used with other interventions (turning, positioning, nutrition)
