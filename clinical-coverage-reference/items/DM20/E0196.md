# E0196 - Gel Pressure Redistribution Mattress (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0196 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a gel pressure mattress that uses gel-filled chambers for conforming pressure redistribution with **cooling properties**. Gel provides excellent pressure distribution by conforming to body contours while offering a cooling effect beneficial for heat-intolerant patients or those with excessive perspiration. Lighter than water mattresses but with similar conforming benefits.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Gel-filled chambers** - conforming pressure redistribution
- **Cooling properties** - gel dissipates heat, reduces perspiration
- **Full mattress replacement** - replaces entire standard mattress
- **Moderate weight** - lighter than water, heavier than foam/air

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with complete or partial immobility
- Any stage pressure ulcer (Stage 1-4) on trunk/pelvis
- Risk factors present: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
- Patients with **heat intolerance** or **excessive perspiration**
- Patients requiring cooling comfort for better sleep/healing

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery)** including:
  - Complete or partial immobility documented
  - Any stage pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis (location, stage, size)
  - At least one risk factor: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
  - **Justification for gel mattress** (if questioned - cooling properties, conforming support)
- **Face-to-face exam within 6 months** documenting:
  - Pressure ulcer assessment
  - Mobility status
  - Risk factors
  - Skin integrity
  - Heat intolerance or perspiration issues (if applicable)
- **Comprehensive pressure ulcer treatment program:**
  - Turning and positioning
  - Wound care protocol
  - Nutritional interventions
  - Incontinence management
- **No bottoming out** - patient must not compress mattress fully

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (GROUP 1 device)

**Important Notes:**
- GROUP 1 device - straightforward coverage
- Any stage pressure ulcer qualifies
- Cooling properties beneficial but not required for coverage
- Must document risk factors

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **DVS (Dispensing Validation System) authorization required**
- **Rental up to 10 months**
- **Face-to-face exam** documented
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days
- **Documentation:**
  - Complete or partial immobility
  - Any stage pressure ulcer trunk/pelvis
  - Risk factors (at least one)
  - Comprehensive treatment program
  - Patient does not bottom out
  - Rationale for gel mattress (cooling, conforming support)

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization required
- 10-month rental limit
- Monthly rental billing
- Cooling properties may justify selection

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0196 - Gel pressure mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx)
- [ ] **Immobility status:**
  - [ ] Completely immobile (bed-bound) OR
  - [ ] Partially immobile (limited mobility, majority time in bed)
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer documentation:**
  - [ ] Location: trunk/pelvis
  - [ ] Stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable, DTI
  - [ ] Measurements
  - [ ] Appearance
- [ ] **Risk factors (≥1):**
  - [ ] Malnutrition (albumin, BMI, intake)
  - [ ] Incontinence (frequency, type)
  - [ ] Altered sensation (testing)
  - [ ] Compromised circulation (ABI, perfusion)
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months
- [ ] **Comprehensive treatment program:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning schedule
  - [ ] Wound care protocol
  - [ ] Nutritional interventions
  - [ ] Incontinence management
- [ ] **No bottoming out** documented
- [ ] **Justification for gel mattress (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Heat intolerance (document: excessive perspiration, discomfort from heat, sleep disruption from warmth)
  - [ ] Cooling properties beneficial for wound healing environment
  - [ ] Superior conforming support needed
  - [ ] Patient preference for gel vs. other materials (tried alternatives)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No documented pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis"** - Location requirement. Fix: Document pressure ulcer location specifically (sacrum, hip, buttock, heel, other trunk/pelvis).

2. **"No risk factors documented"** - Coverage requires risk factors. Fix: Document at least one with objective data: malnutrition (albumin <3.5, BMI <18.5), incontinence (frequency), altered sensation (testing), compromised circulation (ABI, perfusion).

3. **"Comprehensive treatment program not documented"** - Required for GROUP 1. Fix: Document complete plan: turning schedule (every 2 hours, technique), wound care (dressings, frequency), nutrition (goals, supplements), incontinence management (specific strategies).

4. **"No face-to-face exam within 6 months"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: Document face-to-face exam within 6 months with pressure ulcer assessment, mobility, risk factors.

5. **"Why gel mattress vs. other GROUP 1 options?"** - Payer may question selection. Fix: Document rationale: "Patient has excessive night sweats and heat intolerance - gel cooling properties improve sleep and healing environment" or "Patient perspiration issues - gel dissipates moisture better than foam" or "Patient requires conforming support with cooling - gel provides both benefits."

6. **"Patient bottoming out on mattress"** - Inadequate pressure redistribution. Fix: Document adequate gel thickness - hand check shows gap between patient and bed frame. If bottoming out, may need alternative or additional overlay.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare/Medicaid:**
- GROUP 1 device - **no PA for Medicare**
- **DVS authorization for Medicaid**
- Same basic documentation as other GROUP 1 devices
- **Cooling properties** are therapeutic benefit but not required for coverage

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Take photos of pressure ulcer
- Measure precisely
- Document risk factors with objective data
- If patient has heat intolerance/perspiration: **document this** (supports gel selection)
- Create comprehensive care plan

**Device Selection - Gel vs. Other Mattresses:**

**Use GEL MATTRESS (E0196) if:**
- Patient has **heat intolerance** or **excessive perspiration**
- **Cooling properties** clinically beneficial
- Patient needs **conforming support** (similar to water but lighter)
- Patient prefers gel sensation/comfort
- Previous foam mattress too warm

**Consider alternatives if:**
- **Foam (E0184):** Simple, lightweight, no maintenance, cost-effective
- **Air (E0186):** Adjustable firmness, lighter than gel
- **Water (E0187):** Similar conforming but much heavier
- **Powered alternating (E0181):** Dynamic pressure relief needed

**Advantages of Gel Mattress:**
- **Cooling properties** - dissipates heat, reduces perspiration
- **Conforming support** - gel shapes to body contours
- **Even pressure distribution**
- **Moderate weight** - lighter than water, more substantial than air/foam
- No pump, no electricity required
- Durable (no air leaks, no fluid evaporation)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Heavier** than foam or air mattresses
- More expensive than basic foam
- May feel "cool" initially (usually comfortable but some patients dislike)
- Less adjustable than air mattresses
- Moderate maintenance (check gel integrity periodically)

**Cooling Properties - When Clinically Relevant:**
- Excessive night sweats / perspiration
- Heat intolerance (menopause, medications, medical conditions)
- Moisture-related skin breakdown
- Sleep disruption from overheating
- Wound healing environment (cool, dry optimal)
- Summer heat / warm climates
