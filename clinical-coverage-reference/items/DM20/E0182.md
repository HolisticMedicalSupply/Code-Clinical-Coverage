# E0182 - Replacement Pump for Alternating Pressure System

## Clinical Overview

E0182 is a **replacement-only** code for the electric pump component of an alternating pressure pad system. This code is used when the pump malfunctions or fails and the patient continues to require alternating pressure therapy for pressure ulcer management. The pad itself remains functional, but the pump requires replacement.

**Key Features:**
- **Replacement only** - requires existing covered alternating pressure system
- Replaces pump component only (not pad)
- For malfunctioning/defective pumps out of warranty
- Patient must continue to meet GROUP 1 criteria for alternating pressure therapy

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with ongoing alternating pressure pad use
- Pump malfunction (no power, cycling stopped, air pressure loss, mechanical failure)
- Continued medical necessity for pressure ulcer management
- Out of warranty period

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - replacement pump when medical necessity continues

**Requirements:**
- **Existing covered alternating pressure pad system on file**
- **Proof of pump malfunction:**
  - Specific malfunction description (no power, stopped cycling, air pressure loss, motor failure)
  - Out of warranty documentation
  - Pad remains functional
- **Current appropriate use documented:**
  - Patient continues to use alternating pressure system
  - Continued medical necessity for pressure redistribution
  - Ongoing pressure ulcer management OR high risk for pressure ulcers
- **Continued GROUP 1 criteria:**
  - Complete or limited mobility
  - Pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis (or high risk)
  - Risk factors present
- **Face-to-face exam** documenting continued medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required for Medicare

**Important Notes:**
- Replacement based on malfunction, not scheduled/routine replacement
- Warranty status affects coverage - must be out of warranty
- Pad must remain functional (if pad also needs replacement, use A4640)

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes - authorization level depends on cost

**Requirements:**
- **Cost-based authorization:**
  - **If replacement cost >25% of original device:** Prior Approval required
  - **If replacement cost ≤25% of original device:** DVS authorization only
- **Existing alternating pressure system approved and on file**
- **Pump malfunction documentation:**
  - Specific malfunction (no power, cycles stopped, air pressure loss, mechanical failure)
  - Out of warranty
  - Repair attempted or not feasible
- **Continued medical necessity:**
  - Current pressure ulcer status OR high risk assessment
  - Continued mobility limitations
  - Ongoing comprehensive treatment plan
- **Face-to-face exam** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days

**Important Notes:**
- **25% cost threshold** determines PA vs. DVS authorization
- Must justify replacement vs. repair
- Original system approval must be documented

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Before Ordering Replacement:**
- [ ] Verify patient has existing covered alternating pressure system
- [ ] Assess pump malfunction (test power, cycling, air pressure)
- [ ] Confirm pad remains functional
- [ ] Verify warranty status (must be out of warranty)
- [ ] Assess continued medical necessity for pressure redistribution

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0182 - Pump for alternating pressure pad, replacement only"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx pressure ulcer)
- [ ] **Existing alternating pressure system:**
  - [ ] Original approval date
  - [ ] System type (E0181, E0183, or other)
  - [ ] Current use documented (patient using daily)
- [ ] **Pump malfunction documentation (specific):**
  - [ ] No power/will not turn on
  - [ ] Cycling stopped/irregular cycling
  - [ ] Air pressure loss/inadequate inflation
  - [ ] Motor failure/unusual noises
  - [ ] Out of warranty (warranty period expired)
- [ ] **Pad status:** Confirm pad remains functional (no tears, holds air, adequate inflation)
- [ ] **Continued medical necessity:**
  - [ ] Current pressure ulcer status (location, stage, measurements) OR
  - [ ] High risk assessment (Braden Scale, risk factors)
  - [ ] Continued mobility limitations
- [ ] **Ongoing comprehensive treatment plan:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning
  - [ ] Wound care (if active ulcer)
  - [ ] Nutritional support
  - [ ] Incontinence management
- [ ] Face-to-face exam documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicaid - Additional:**
- [ ] Estimate replacement pump cost
- [ ] Determine if cost >25% of original device cost (if yes, PA required; if no, DVS only)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No existing alternating pressure system on file"** - Replacement requires existing covered system. Fix: Provide documentation of original alternating pressure pad approval. Include original order, approval date, system type.

2. **"Pump malfunction not documented"** - Generic "needs replacement" insufficient. Fix: Provide specific malfunction description: "Pump will not power on despite testing multiple outlets" or "Pump cycling stopped - alternates for 30 seconds then stops, tested multiple times" or "Air pressure inadequate - pump runs but pad does not inflate to therapeutic pressure."

3. **"Pump under warranty"** - Manufacturer warranty coverage. Fix: Document warranty period expired (provide warranty documentation showing expiration date). If under warranty, contact manufacturer for warranty replacement, not insurance coverage.

4. **"Continued medical necessity not documented"** - Ongoing need not shown. Fix: Document current pressure ulcer status with measurements OR high risk assessment showing continued need for pressure redistribution. Include mobility status, risk factors, comprehensive treatment plan.

5. **"Medicaid: Prior approval required but DVS submitted"** - Cost threshold exceeded. Fix: Determine replacement pump cost. If >25% of original device cost, submit for Prior Approval (not DVS). Include cost documentation and justification for replacement vs. new system.

6. **"Pad also non-functional - entire system needs replacement"** - Pump AND pad both failed. Fix: If both pump and pad malfunctioning, may need to order new complete system (E0181/E0183) rather than separate replacements. Document both components failed, cost-effectiveness of new system vs. replacing both components.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific malfunction** - not "broken" or "needs replacement"
- Verify **out of warranty** before ordering (manufacturer warranty typically 1 year)
- Confirm pad remains functional - if pad also needs replacement, consider cost-effectiveness of separate replacements vs. new system
- Document continued medical necessity - ongoing pressure ulcer management or high risk

**Medicaid:**
- **25% cost rule** is critical:
  - Estimate replacement pump cost
  - Compare to original device cost (full system cost at time of purchase)
  - If >25%: full Prior Approval required
  - If ≤25%: DVS authorization only
- Document repair not feasible (pump malfunction not repairable)

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Test pump thoroughly before declaring malfunction (try different outlets, check connections)
- Document specific malfunction symptoms (won't power on, stops cycling, pressure inadequate, motor noise)
- Include warranty documentation showing expiration
- Photograph pump malfunction if possible (error lights, display codes)
- Document continued daily use of system (patient compliance)

**Cost Considerations:**
- Sometimes new complete system (E0181) is more cost-effective than replacing both pump (E0182) and pad (A4640)
- If both components failing: compare costs and consider ordering new complete system
- Medicaid 25% threshold may push toward PA even for pump alone
