# E0185 - Gel Pressure Pad/Overlay (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0185 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a gel or gel-like pressure pad/overlay that sits **ON TOP** of an existing mattress. This is more cost-effective than full mattress replacement (E0196 gel mattress) when the existing mattress is adequate but needs additional pressure redistribution. Gel provides conforming support with cooling properties.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Overlay/pad** - sits on top of existing mattress (vs. E0196 full mattress replacement)
- **Gel or gel-like material** - conforming pressure redistribution with cooling
- **Standard mattress length and width**
- Cost-effective alternative to full mattress replacement

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with partial or complete immobility
- Any stage pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis
- Risk factors present
- Existing mattress adequate but needs additional pressure redistribution layer
- More economical than replacing entire mattress

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery)** including:
  - Partial or complete immobility documented
  - Any stage pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis (location, stage, size)
  - At least one risk factor: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
- **Face-to-face exam** documented
- **Comprehensive treatment plan:**
  - Turning and positioning
  - Wound care protocol
  - Nutritional interventions
  - Incontinence management
- **No bottoming out** - gel pad provides adequate pressure redistribution

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (GROUP 1 device)

**Important Notes:**
- Overlay sits on existing mattress
- More cost-effective than full gel mattress (E0196)
- Any stage pressure ulcer qualifies
- Must document risk factors

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **DVS (Dispensing Validation System) authorization required**
- **Face-to-face exam** documented
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days
- **Documentation:**
  - Partial or complete immobility
  - Any stage pressure ulcer trunk/pelvis
  - Risk factors (at least one)
  - Comprehensive treatment plan
  - **Gel pad provides adequate pressure redistribution without bottoming out**

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization - simpler than full PA
- Documentation must show gel pad adequate (no bottoming out)
- Overlay on existing mattress

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0185 - Gel or gel-like pressure pad for mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx)
- [ ] **Immobility status:**
  - [ ] Partial immobility OR
  - [ ] Complete immobility (bed-bound)
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer documentation:**
  - [ ] Location: trunk/pelvis
  - [ ] Stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable, DTI
  - [ ] Measurements
- [ ] **Risk factors (≥1):**
  - [ ] Malnutrition
  - [ ] Incontinence
  - [ ] Altered sensation
  - [ ] Compromised circulation
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** documented
- [ ] **Comprehensive treatment plan:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning
  - [ ] Wound care
  - [ ] Nutrition
  - [ ] Incontinence management
- [ ] **No bottoming out:** Document gel pad provides adequate pressure redistribution
- [ ] **Existing mattress assessment:**
  - [ ] Current mattress type/condition
  - [ ] Why gel overlay appropriate (vs. full mattress replacement)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Why overlay vs. full mattress replacement?"** - Payer may question selection. Fix: Document existing mattress in good condition, gel overlay provides adequate additional pressure redistribution, more cost-effective than full replacement.

2. **"Patient bottoming out on gel pad"** - Inadequate pressure redistribution. Fix: Document adequate gel thickness - hand check shows gap between patient and mattress, no compression to underlying surface. If bottoming out, may need thicker gel pad or full gel mattress (E0196).

3. **"No risk factors documented"** - Coverage requires risk factors. Fix: Document at least one with objective data: malnutrition (albumin, BMI), incontinence (frequency), altered sensation (testing), compromised circulation (ABI, perfusion).

## Tips for Prescribers

**Overlay (E0185) vs. Full Mattress (E0196):**
- **Use E0185 (overlay)** when existing mattress adequate, just needs additional pressure redistribution layer
- **Use E0196 (full mattress)** when existing mattress inadequate/worn, need complete replacement
- E0185 more cost-effective - prefer when appropriate

**Documentation:**
- Document existing mattress condition
- Justify overlay vs. full replacement
- Verify no bottoming out with gel pad
