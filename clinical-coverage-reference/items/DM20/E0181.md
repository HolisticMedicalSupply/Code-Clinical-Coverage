# E0181 - Alternating Pressure Overlay System with Pump (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0181 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a powered alternating pressure overlay system that sits on top of a standard mattress. The system includes an electric pump that alternates air pressure through different chambers in the pad, providing dynamic pressure redistribution for pressure ulcer treatment and prevention. This is a **basic support surface** with straightforward coverage - no prior authorization required.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Alternating pressure** - pump cycles air between chambers
- **Overlay design** - placed on top of existing mattress
- **Includes pump** - complete system
- **Includes heavy duty options** - bariatric/higher weight capacity

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with complete or limited mobility
- Any stage pressure ulcer (Stage 1-4) on trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock)
- Risk factors present: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, poor circulation
- GROUP 1 device - first-line therapy for pressure ulcer management

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery)** including:
  - Complete or limited mobility documented
  - Any stage pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis (location, stage, size)
  - Risk factors documented: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation
- **Face-to-face exam within 6 months** documenting:
  - Pressure ulcer assessment (location, stage, measurements)
  - Mobility status
  - Risk factors
  - Skin integrity assessment
- **Comprehensive pressure ulcer treatment program:**
  - Turning and positioning schedule
  - Wound care protocol
  - Nutritional assessment and interventions
  - Incontinence management plan
- **No bottoming out** - patient must not compress overlay fully (adequate pressure redistribution)

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (GROUP 1 device)

**Rental:** Typically capped rental period *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- GROUP 1 device - straightforward coverage without complex approval process
- Any stage pressure ulcer qualifies (Stage 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable)
- Must have at least one risk factor documented
- Heavy duty options included in same code

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **DVS (Dispensing Validation System) authorization required**
- **Rental up to 10 months**
- **Face-to-face exam** documented
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days
- **Documentation:**
  - Complete or limited mobility
  - Any stage pressure ulcer trunk/pelvis (location, stage, measurements)
  - Risk factors: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, poor circulation
  - Comprehensive ulcer treatment program (turning, wound care, nutrition, incontinence)
  - Patient does not bottom out on surface

**Important Notes:**
- DVS authorization - simpler process than full prior approval
- 10-month rental limit
- Must document comprehensive treatment program
- Monthly rental billing

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0181 - Powered pressure reducing air overlay, alternating, with pump"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx pressure ulcer)
- [ ] **Mobility status:**
  - [ ] Complete immobility (bed-bound) OR
  - [ ] Limited mobility (requires assistance, spends majority of day in bed/chair)
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer documentation:**
  - [ ] Location: trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock, heel, etc.)
  - [ ] Stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable, or deep tissue injury
  - [ ] Size measurements (length x width x depth)
  - [ ] Appearance (color, drainage, necrotic tissue, etc.)
- [ ] **Risk factors (document â‰¥1):**
  - [ ] Malnutrition (albumin levels, BMI, nutritional assessment)
  - [ ] Incontinence (urinary, fecal, or both)
  - [ ] Altered sensation (neuropathy, spinal cord injury, decreased sensation)
  - [ ] Compromised circulation (peripheral vascular disease, edema, poor perfusion)
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months documented
- [ ] **Comprehensive pressure ulcer treatment plan:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning schedule (frequency, technique)
  - [ ] Wound care protocol (dressings, debridement, cleansing)
  - [ ] Nutritional interventions (diet modifications, supplements, tube feeding)
  - [ ] Incontinence management (toileting schedule, barrier creams, catheter)
- [ ] **No bottoming out:** Document patient does not compress overlay completely (adequate pressure redistribution)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No documented pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis"** - Location requirement. Fix: Document pressure ulcer location specifically (sacrum, hip, buttock, heel, other trunk/pelvis). If ulcer on extremity only (arm, leg), GROUP 1 support surface may not be appropriate - address trunk/pelvis positioning.

2. **"No risk factors documented"** - Coverage requires risk factors. Fix: Document at least one risk factor: malnutrition (albumin <3.5, BMI <18.5, poor intake), incontinence (frequency, type), altered sensation (neuropathy testing, sensation assessment), compromised circulation (ABI, edema, perfusion assessment).

3. **"Comprehensive treatment plan not documented"** - Treatment program required. Fix: Document complete plan including turning/positioning schedule (every 2 hours, technique), wound care protocol (specific dressings, frequency), nutritional interventions (calorie/protein goals, supplements), incontinence management (specific strategies).

4. **"No face-to-face exam within 6 months"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: Document face-to-face exam within 6 months of order. Include pressure ulcer assessment, mobility evaluation, skin inspection, risk factor assessment.

5. **"Patient bottoming out on surface"** - Inadequate pressure redistribution. Fix: Document overlay provides adequate pressure redistribution - hand check shows gap between patient and mattress, no compression of overlay to mattress surface. If patient too heavy/large, document need for heavy duty option.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- GROUP 1 device - **no PA required**, straightforward coverage
- **Any stage** pressure ulcer qualifies (Stage 1 through 4)
- At least **one risk factor** must be documented
- Comprehensive treatment plan is **not optional** - required for coverage

**Medicaid:**
- **DVS authorization required** - submit through DVS system
- **10-month rental limit** - plan accordingly
- Same documentation requirements as Medicare
- Monthly rental billing

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Take photos of pressure ulcer (include ruler for scale)
- Measure precisely (length x width x depth in cm)
- Document risk factors with objective data (albumin level, incontinence frequency, sensation testing results)
- Create comprehensive treatment plan **before** ordering device
- Use Braden Scale or similar risk assessment tool

**Device Selection:**
- E0181 (overlay) vs E0183 (underlay): Overlay sits on top of mattress (typical), underlay goes beneath mattress (less common)
- Heavy duty option: Same code, specify in notes if patient >250 lbs or bariatric needs
- If patient requires more advanced features: Consider GROUP 2 devices (requires 30-day GROUP 1 trial failure first)
