# E0277 - Powered Air Mattress (GROUP 2 Advanced Support Surface)

## ðŸš¨ PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED (Medicare & Medicaid)

## Clinical Overview

E0277 is a **GROUP 2 advanced support surface** - a powered pressure-reducing air mattress for complex pressure ulcers that have failed GROUP 1 therapy. This device provides powered air pressure redistribution with more sophisticated features than basic GROUP 1 devices. **Prior authorization required** for both Medicare and Medicaid, with mandatory 30-day GROUP 1 trial failure documentation (or qualifying Stage 3-4/post-surgical criteria).

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 2 device** - advanced support surface, **PA REQUIRED**
- **Powered air** - electric pump with sophisticated pressure control
- **Full mattress** - replaces entire standard mattress
- Requires **failed 30-day GROUP 1 trial** (or Stage 3-4/post-surgical qualification)

**Three Pathways to Coverage:**
1. **Multiple Stage 2 ulcers** failed GROUP 1 for 30+ days (documented progression)
2. **Large or multiple Stage 3-4 ulcers** on trunk/pelvis
3. **Post-flap/graft surgery** within 60 days
