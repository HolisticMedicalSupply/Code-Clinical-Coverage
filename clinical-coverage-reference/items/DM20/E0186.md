# E0186 - Air Pressure Redistribution Mattress (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0186 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - an air pressure mattress that uses air chambers for static pressure redistribution. Unlike powered alternating pressure systems (E0181/E0183 with electric pumps), this is a **static or manually adjustable air mattress** - air chambers are inflated manually or remain at constant pressure without alternating cycles. Provides pressure redistribution with adjustable firmness capability.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface, no PA required
- **Air chambers** - static air or manually adjustable (not powered alternating)
- **Adjustable firmness** - can modify air pressure for comfort/therapeutic needs
- **Full mattress replacement** - replaces entire standard mattress
- Lighter weight than water mattresses

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with immobility (bed-bound or limited mobility)
- Any stage pressure ulcer (Stage 1-4) on trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock, heel)
- At least one risk factor: malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, poor circulation
- May benefit from adjustable firmness (weight fluctuations, comfort needs, therapeutic adjustments)

## Coverage Details

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0186 - Air pressure mattress"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx pressure ulcer)
- [ ] **Immobility status:**
  - [ ] Bed-bound (cannot get out of bed independently) OR
  - [ ] Immobile (spends majority of day in bed, limited mobility)
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer documentation:**
  - [ ] Location: trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock) or heel
  - [ ] Stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable, or deep tissue injury
  - [ ] Size measurements (length x width x depth)
  - [ ] Appearance
- [ ] **Risk factors (document ≥1):**
  - [ ] Malnutrition (albumin levels, BMI, nutritional assessment)
  - [ ] Incontinence (urinary, fecal, or both - frequency, management)
  - [ ] Altered sensation (neuropathy, decreased sensation testing)
  - [ ] Poor circulation (peripheral vascular disease, edema, poor perfusion)
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months documented
- [ ] **Comprehensive care plan:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning schedule (frequency, technique)
  - [ ] Wound care protocol (dressings, frequency)
  - [ ] Nutritional interventions (goals, supplements)
  - [ ] Incontinence management (toileting, barriers)
- [ ] **No bottoming out:** Document adequate air pressure/inflation - patient does not compress mattress to bed frame
- [ ] **Justification for air mattress (if questioned):**
  - [ ] Adjustable firmness needed (weight fluctuations, comfort, therapeutic adjustments)
  - [ ] Patient/caregiver preference for air vs. other materials
  - [ ] Clinical benefit of air-based pressure redistribution
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No documented pressure ulcer on trunk/pelvis"** - Location requirement. Fix: Document pressure ulcer location specifically (sacrum, hip, buttock, heel, other trunk/pelvis). If ulcer only on extremity, GROUP 1 mattress may not be appropriate.

2. **"No risk factors documented"** - Coverage requires at least one risk factor. Fix: Document at least one risk factor with objective data: malnutrition (albumin <3.5, BMI <18.5, poor intake), incontinence (frequency, type), altered sensation (monofilament testing, sensory exam), poor circulation (ABI <0.9, edema, capillary refill >2 seconds).

3. **"Comprehensive care plan not documented"** - Treatment program required. Fix: Document complete plan including turning schedule (every 2 hours, specific technique), wound care protocol (dressings, frequency), nutritional interventions (calorie/protein goals, supplements), incontinence management (specific strategies).

4. **"No face-to-face exam within 6 months"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: Document face-to-face exam within 6 months of order. Include pressure ulcer assessment, mobility evaluation, skin inspection, risk factor assessment.

5. **"Patient bottoming out on mattress"** - Inadequate pressure redistribution. Fix: Document adequate air inflation - hand check under sacrum/heels shows gap between patient and bed frame, no full compression. Adjust air pressure to appropriate firmness. If patient too heavy and bottoms out despite proper inflation, may need alternative support surface.

6. **"Why air mattress vs. other GROUP 1 options?"** - Payer may question selection. Fix: Document rationale: "Patient weight fluctuates due to edema/dehydration cycles - adjustable air pressure allows therapeutic firmness modification" or "Patient requires softer surface for comfort but firmer support during transfers - manually adjustable air allows customization" or "Previous foam mattress showed compression - air mattress prevents bottoming out."

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- GROUP 1 device - **no PA required**, straightforward coverage
- **Any stage** pressure ulcer qualifies
- At least **one risk factor** must be documented
- Comprehensive care plan is **required**

**Medicaid:**
- **DVS authorization required** - submit through DVS system
- **10-month rental limit** - plan accordingly
- Same documentation requirements as Medicare
- Monthly rental billing

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- Take photos of pressure ulcer (include ruler)
- Measure precisely (length x width x depth in cm)
- Document risk factors with objective data
- Document air pressure/inflation level (if measurable)
- Create comprehensive care plan before ordering
- Use Braden Scale (score <18 = high risk)

**Device Selection - Air vs. Other Mattresses:**

**Use AIR MATTRESS (E0186) if:**
- Patient needs **adjustable firmness** (weight fluctuations, comfort adjustments, therapeutic modifications)
- **Lighter weight** needed compared to water (easier handling/transport)
- Patient/caregiver prefers air-based support
- Previous foam mattress showed compression/bottoming out
- Need to customize pressure redistribution over time

**Consider alternatives if:**
- **Dry mattress (E0184):** No electricity/maintenance preferred, simple reliable static surface
- **Powered alternating pressure (E0181):** Need dynamic pressure relief (alternating cycles), multiple/worsening ulcers
- **Gel mattress (E0196):** Patient has heat intolerance, needs cooling properties
- **Water mattress (E0187):** Fluid-based redistribution preferred (less common due to weight)

**Advantages of Air Mattress:**
- **Adjustable firmness** - customize for patient weight, comfort, therapeutic needs
- **Lightweight** compared to water mattresses
- **Even pressure distribution** when properly inflated
- Can modify over time as patient condition changes
- Good for patients with weight fluctuations

**Disadvantages:**
- May require periodic **air pressure checks/adjustments**
- Potential for **air leaks** (punctures, valve failures)
- Some patients find air sensation uncomfortable
- May need **manual pump** or **inflation device**
- Less stable surface than foam (can affect transfers)

**Air Mattress vs. Powered Alternating Air:**
- **E0186 (this code):** Static or manually adjustable air - constant pressure, no alternating cycles, no electric pump
- **E0181:** Powered alternating pressure - electric pump alternates air pressure through cycles automatically
- E0186 simpler, no electricity required, lower maintenance
- E0181 provides dynamic pressure relief (more therapeutic for some patients)
