# E0183 - Alternating Pressure Underlay System with Pump (GROUP 1)

## Clinical Overview

E0183 is a **GROUP 1 support surface** - a powered alternating pressure underlay system that is placed **beneath** the standard mattress (unlike overlay E0181 which sits on top). The system includes an electric pump that alternates air pressure through different chambers in the underlay pad. This configuration is less common than overlay systems and typically requires specific justification related to bed design, patient transfer needs, or home setup constraints.

**Key Features:**
- **GROUP 1 device** - basic support surface (Medicare: no PA required)
- **Underlay design** - placed BENEATH mattress (vs. overlay on top)
- **Alternating pressure** - pump cycles air between chambers
- **Includes pump** - complete system
- **Includes heavy duty options** - bariatric/higher weight capacity
- **NY Medicaid: PA required** (unlike overlay E0181 which only needs DVS)

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient with complete or limited immobility
- Pressure ulcer(s) on trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock)
- Risk factors present
- Specific bed/home setup requiring underlay configuration
- **Must justify why underlay needed instead of more common overlay**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes - GROUP 1 support surface (no PA required)

**Requirements:**
- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery)** including:
  - Complete or limited immobility documented
  - Pressure ulcer(s) on trunk/pelvis (location, stage, size)
  - Risk factors present (malnutrition, incontinence, altered sensation, compromised circulation)
  - **Justification for underlay vs. overlay:** Bed design, patient transfer needs, home constraints
- **Face-to-face exam within 6 months** documenting:
  - Pressure ulcer assessment (location, stage, measurements)
  - Mobility status
  - Risk factors
  - Home/bed setup assessment
- **Comprehensive treatment plan:**
  - Turning and positioning schedule
  - Wound care protocol
  - Nutritional assessment and interventions
  - Incontinence management plan

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required for Medicare (GROUP 1 device)

**Important Notes:**
- GROUP 1 device - no PA for Medicare
- Underlay configuration less common than overlay
- Should document why underlay preferred/necessary
- May be questioned if no justification for underlay configuration provided

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes with Prior Approval + DVS authorization

**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED** (unlike overlay E0181 which only needs DVS)
- **Must justify underlay vs. overlay configuration:**
  - Bed design constraints (rails interfere with overlay)
  - Patient transfer mechanics (overlay creates height/edge issues)
  - Home setup requirements (caregiver access, bed configuration)
  - Clinical justification (specific patient positioning needs)
- **DVS authorization also required**
- **Face-to-face exam** documented
- **Fiscal order** within 30 days
- **Documentation:**
  - Complete or limited immobility
  - Pressure ulcer(s) trunk/pelvis (location, stage, measurements)
  - Risk factors present
  - **Specific underlay justification** (why overlay insufficient)
  - Comprehensive treatment plan

**Important Notes:**
- **PA required** - more restrictive than overlay (E0181)
- Must provide **specific justification** for underlay configuration
- Both PA and DVS authorization needed
- Underlay less commonly approved than overlay

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Documentation:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0183 - Powered pressure reducing air underlay, alternating, with pump"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (L89.xxx pressure ulcer)
- [ ] **Immobility documentation:**
  - [ ] Complete immobility (bed-bound) OR
  - [ ] Limited immobility (requires assistance, majority of time in bed/chair)
- [ ] **Pressure ulcer(s) documentation:**
  - [ ] Location: trunk/pelvis (sacrum, hip, buttock)
  - [ ] Stage: 1, 2, 3, 4, unstageable, or deep tissue injury
  - [ ] Size measurements (length x width x depth)
  - [ ] Appearance
- [ ] **Risk factors present:**
  - [ ] Malnutrition
  - [ ] Incontinence
  - [ ] Altered sensation
  - [ ] Compromised circulation
- [ ] **CRITICAL for Medicaid - Underlay justification (specific):**
  - [ ] Bed rail design interferes with overlay placement
  - [ ] Patient transfer needs - overlay creates fall risk/edge hazard
  - [ ] Bed height with overlay creates caregiver ergonomic issues
  - [ ] Home bed configuration requires underlay (specific bed type, setup constraints)
  - [ ] Clinical positioning requirements favor underlay design
  - [ ] **Why overlay (E0181) insufficient/inappropriate for this patient**
- [ ] **Face-to-face exam** within 6 months documented
- [ ] **Comprehensive treatment plan:**
  - [ ] Turning/repositioning schedule
  - [ ] Wound care protocol
  - [ ] Nutritional interventions
  - [ ] Incontinence management
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Medicaid: No justification for underlay vs. overlay"** - PA requires specific rationale. Fix: Provide detailed justification: "Hospital bed side rails extend above mattress surface preventing proper overlay placement" or "Patient requires multiple daily transfers with mechanical lift - overlay height (4 inches) creates fall hazard at bed edge" or "Bariatric bed frame design incompatible with overlay weight distribution - underlay provides proper support structure."

2. **"Overlay (E0181) should be tried first"** - Underlay requires justification before approval. Fix: Document why overlay inappropriate: bed/home assessment showing overlay incompatibility, safety concerns with overlay configuration, clinical need for underlay design. If no clear contraindication to overlay, may need to trial overlay first.

3. **"No risk factors documented"** - GROUP 1 requires risk factors. Fix: Document at least one risk factor with objective data: malnutrition (albumin, BMI, intake), incontinence (frequency, type), altered sensation (testing), compromised circulation (ABI, perfusion).

4. **"Comprehensive treatment plan not documented"** - Required for GROUP 1. Fix: Document complete plan: turning schedule (every 2 hours, technique), wound care (dressings, frequency), nutrition (calorie/protein goals, supplements), incontinence management (toileting, barriers, catheter).

5. **"No face-to-face exam within 6 months"** - Medicare requirement. Fix: Document face-to-face exam within 6 months. Include pressure ulcer assessment, mobility evaluation, home/bed assessment, risk factors.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- GROUP 1 device - **no PA required**
- However, **underlay configuration may be questioned** if no justification provided
- Include rationale for underlay vs. overlay in notes (bed design, transfer needs, home setup)
- Most patients appropriate for overlay (E0181) - use underlay only when specific reason exists

**Medicaid:**
- **PA REQUIRED** - unlike overlay (E0181) which only needs DVS
- **Must provide specific justification** for underlay vs. overlay
- Common acceptable reasons:
  - Bed rail interference with overlay placement
  - Patient transfer safety with mechanical lift (overlay height creates hazard)
  - Bariatric bed frame design requiring underlay support structure
  - Caregiver access/ergonomics (overlay height problematic)
- **Both PA and DVS** required - plan for longer approval process than overlay

**Underlay vs. Overlay Decision Tree:**

**Use OVERLAY (E0181) if:**
- Standard hospital or home bed
- No bed rail interference
- Patient transfers manageable with standard bed height
- No specific bed design constraints
- **(This is the DEFAULT/most common choice)**

**Use UNDERLAY (E0183) if:**
- Bed rails extend above mattress preventing overlay placement
- Bed frame design incompatible with overlay
- Patient transfer mechanics require lower bed surface
- Bariatric bed requiring underlay support structure
- Specific home/caregiver constraints favoring underlay

**Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Take photos** of bed setup showing why overlay inappropriate (bed rails, frame design, transfer area)
- **Measure bed dimensions** and document overlay height impact on total bed height
- **Document home assessment** by OT/PT if available (bed setup, transfer mechanics, caregiver ergonomics)
- **Include bed model** and specifications if specialized bed
- **Be specific** - not "patient needs underlay" but "hospital bed rails extend 6 inches above mattress surface, preventing proper overlay placement and creating pressure point risks"
