# E0990 - Elevating Leg Rest (Complete Assembly)

## Clinical Overview

E0990 represents an elevating leg rest complete assembly providing leg elevation capability on wheelchairs. Unlike standard footrests that position legs at 90-degree knee flexion, elevating legrests allow leg elevation for edema management, orthopedic conditions, or use with reclining backs.

**CRITICAL COVERAGE CRITERIA:** Patient must meet **ONE of THREE** specific criteria:
1. Musculoskeletal condition or cast/brace preventing 90-degree knee flexion, OR
2. Significant edema of lower extremities requiring leg elevation, OR
3. Patient has reclining back on wheelchair

**Key Features:**
- Complete elevating legrest assembly
- Allows leg elevation beyond 90-degree knee flexion
- Billed as 2 units (one pair) using E0990 code
- Used with manual or power wheelchairs

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- CHF patient with chronic lower extremity edema requiring leg elevation
- Post-surgical orthopedic patient with knee cast preventing 90-degree flexion
- Patient with reclining wheelchair back (legrests must elevate with back recline)
- Lymphedema patient requiring dependent leg positioning

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0990 - Elevating leg rest, complete assembly, each"**
- [ ] **Quantity: 2 (one pair - bill as 2 units)**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (edema, venous insufficiency, orthopedic condition, CHF)
- [ ] **Documentation meeting ONE of THREE coverage criteria:**

  **CRITERION 1 - Musculoskeletal/Cast/Brace:**
  - [ ] Musculoskeletal condition preventing 90-degree knee flexion
  - [ ] OR cast/brace preventing 90-degree knee flexion
  - [ ] ROM measurements documenting limitation
  - [ ] Duration of condition (temporary vs permanent)

  **CRITERION 2 - Significant Edema:**
  - [ ] Significant lower extremity edema requiring leg elevation
  - [ ] Edema measurements (circumference, pitting grade)
  - [ ] Underlying cause (CHF, venous insufficiency, lymphedema)
  - [ ] Medical necessity for leg elevation

  **CRITERION 3 - Reclining Back:**
  - [ ] Patient has reclining back on wheelchair
  - [ ] Elevating legrests required to coordinate with back recline
  - [ ] Medical necessity for reclining back documented separately

- [ ] **Medical necessity justification**
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation** (recommended for Medicare, REQUIRED for Medicaid)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Documentation of qualifying condition
- [ ] Measurement documentation if applicable
- [ ] Face-to-face if provided with new power wheelchair

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order with PA/DVS):**
- [ ] PA application submitted
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation (REQUIRED)
- [ ] Comprehensive WME guidelines documentation
- [ ] Measurements and medical necessity

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Does not meet coverage criteria"** - Patient doesn't meet any of the 3 criteria. Fix: Must document patient meets AT LEAST ONE criterion: (1) Musculoskeletal condition/cast/brace preventing 90-degree flexion, OR (2) Significant edema requiring elevation, OR (3) Reclining back. Standard wheelchair users without these conditions do NOT qualify for elevating legrests.

2. **"Convenience item"** - Perceived as comfort rather than medical necessity. Fix: Elevating legrests are NOT for comfort or convenience. Document specific medical indication: "Patient with CHF and chronic venous insufficiency; bilateral lower extremity edema 3+ pitting, calf circumference 45cm (baseline 36cm); elevating legrests medically necessary for dependent leg positioning to reduce edema; criterion 2 met (significant edema requiring leg elevation)."

3. **"Measurements missing"** (especially for edema criterion). Fix: Include objective measurements: edema circumference, pitting grade, ROM limitations if applicable. Example: "Bilateral lower extremity edema: right calf 44cm, left calf 46cm (baseline both 36cm); 3+ pitting edema; elevating legrests required for leg elevation to reduce edema."

4. **"Billed at initial wheelchair issue"** (if not criteria met). Fix: Elevating legrests included at initial wheelchair issue only if criteria met at that time. If criteria develop later (e.g., new edema), can bill as addition. If replacing existing elevating legrests, document replacement need.

5. **"Wrong code for rental wheelchair"** - E0990 billed for rental wheelchair. Fix: Use K0195 for elevating legrests on RENTAL wheelchairs (capped rental basis). E0990 is for PURCHASED wheelchairs.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Must meet ONE of THREE criteria** - document clearly which criterion met *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include **objective measurements** (edema circumference, ROM limitations) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** - strengthens justification *(Under Review)*
- Face-to-face required if provided with new power wheelchair
- **Check rental vs purchase** - use K0195 for rental wheelchairs

**NY Medicaid:**
- **PA and DVS authorization REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation REQUIRED** (mandatory) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Comprehensive documentation per WME guidelines
- Measurements and medical necessity clearly documented

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Edema criterion**: "Patient with CHF (EF 25%); chronic bilateral lower extremity edema; calf circumference: right 44cm, left 46cm (baseline both 35cm); 3+ pitting edema; elevating legrests medically necessary for dependent leg positioning to reduce edema and prevent skin breakdown; meets criterion 2 (significant edema requiring leg elevation)"
- **Orthopedic criterion**: "Patient with bilateral knee osteoarthritis; cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion (ROM limited to 110 degrees bilaterally); elevating legrests required to accommodate knee extension contractures; meets criterion 1 (musculoskeletal condition preventing 90-degree flexion)"
- **Reclining back criterion**: "Patient has reclining back on power wheelchair for pressure relief (reclines to 120 degrees); elevating legrests required to coordinate with back recline; meets criterion 3 (reclining back on wheelchair)"

## Related Codes

- **E0990** - Elevating leg rest, complete assembly (this code) - for purchased wheelchairs
- **K0195** - Elevating leg rests, pair (for capped rental wheelchair base) - for rental wheelchairs
- **E0995** - Calf rest/pad, replacement only - accessory for elevating legrests
- **E1012** - Power elevating leg rest - powered leg elevation (different from manual)
- **E1225/E1226** - Reclining backs - often used with elevating legrests (criterion 3)

**Note:** E0990 for PURCHASED wheelchairs. K0195 for RENTAL wheelchairs. Use correct code based on wheelchair rental vs purchase status.
