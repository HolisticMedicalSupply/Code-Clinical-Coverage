# E1020 - Residual Limb Support System

## Clinical Overview

E1020 represents a residual limb support system for wheelchair users with lower extremity amputations. This accessory provides positioning, protection, and edema management for the residual limb (stump) when the patient is using the wheelchair. Different from elevating legrests (E0990) which are for intact legs; residual limb supports are specifically designed to accommodate stump length and shape.

**Key Features:**
- Supports and positions residual limb
- Protects stump from trauma
- Manages stump edema
- Accommodates stump when prosthesis not worn
- Adjustable to amputation level (BKA, AKA, hip disarticulation)
- Can be used with manual or power wheelchairs

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- BKA patient with stump edema requiring elevation and support while in wheelchair
- AKA patient not wearing prosthesis requiring stump positioning
- New amputee with stump edema during prosthetic training phase
- Bilateral amputee needing stump support when not wearing prostheses

- [ ] **Amputation documentation:**
  - [ ] Level of amputation (BKA, AKA, hip disarticulation, bilateral)
  - [ ] Date of amputation
  - [ ] Residual limb length
- [ ] **Medical necessity for residual limb support:**
  - [ ] Stump edema requiring elevation/support
  - [ ] Stump protection from trauma

  - [ ] Stump condition (healed, edema present, neuroma, other complications)
  - [ ] Why residual limb support needed in wheelchair
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation recommended** (positioning needs, stump measurements)
- [ ] Physician signature and date

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Written order specifying residual limb support system
- [ ] Documentation of amputation level
- [ ] Medical necessity for support system
- [ ] Positioning/edema management needs

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Elevating legrests adequate"** - Confusion with E0990 elevating legrests. Fix: E1020 is specifically for RESIDUAL LIMB (stump) support, not intact leg elevation. Elevating legrests (E0990) are designed for intact legs and do not accommodate stump length/shape. Document: "Patient has left AKA; residual limb 8 inches from hip; standard elevating legrests (E0990) inadequate as designed for intact leg length; E1020 residual limb support specifically designed to accommodate stump length and provide proper positioning/edema management for residual limb."

2. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Unclear why support needed. Fix: Document specific medical need: "Patient with right BKA; stump edema present (4+ pitting); requires residual limb elevation and support for edema management while in wheelchair; patient wears prosthesis for ambulation but removes for rest periods in wheelchair; residual limb support medically necessary for edema control during non-prosthetic wheelchair time."

3. **"Prosthesis provided"** - Assumption that prosthesis eliminates need. Fix: Many amputees need residual limb support when NOT wearing prosthesis: "Patient has prosthesis for ambulation but cannot wear continuously (skin breakdown risk, stump volume changes, rest periods); uses wheelchair for home mobility and rest periods without prosthesis; residual limb support system medically necessary for stump positioning and edema management during non-prosthetic periods."

4. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** (especially Medicaid) - Missing positioning assessment. Fix: While not required for Medicare, PT/OT evaluation significantly strengthens justification. Should document: amputation level and stump length, stump edema measurements, positioning needs to prevent contractures, trial of residual limb support system successful.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific amputation level and stump length** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **medical necessity** (edema management, positioning, protection) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** - strengthens justification *(Under Review)*
- Document **prosthesis status** and why support needed in wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Amputation documentation** (level, date, stump length) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Detailed medical necessity** for support system *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** *(Under Review)*
- May require PA - check first

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **BKA with edema**: "Patient with left BKA (10-inch stump from knee); stump edema 3+ pitting; requires residual limb elevation and support for edema management while in wheelchair; prosthesis worn for ambulation but removed for home mobility in wheelchair; residual limb support system medically necessary for edema control and stump positioning during non-prosthetic periods"
- **AKA positioning**: "Patient with right AKA (6-inch stump from hip); risk of hip flexion contracture without proper positioning; uses wheelchair for primary mobility (not prosthesis candidate due to cardiovascular status); residual limb support system medically necessary to maintain proper hip extension positioning and prevent contractures"
- **PT/OT assessment**: "PT evaluation 10/25/2025: Patient has bilateral BKA; stump lengths 8 inches (right) and 9 inches (left); 3+ pitting edema both stumps; requires bilateral residual limb support for edema management in wheelchair; uses wheelchair for home mobility when not wearing prostheses; residual limb supports medically necessary for stump positioning and edema control"

## Related Codes

- **E1020** - Residual limb support system (this code)
- **E0990** - Elevating leg rest - for INTACT legs (not residual limbs)
- **K0108** - Wheelchair component/accessory NOS

**Note:** E1020 is for RESIDUAL LIMBS (amputated). E0990 is for INTACT LEGS. Different anatomy, different positioning needs, different codes.
