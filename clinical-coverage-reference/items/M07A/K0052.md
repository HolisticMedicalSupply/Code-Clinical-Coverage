# K0052 - Swingaway/Detachable Footrests (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

K0052 represents swingaway or detachable footrests for power wheelchairs, billed as replacement only (not at initial wheelchair issue). These footrests can swing away to the side or be completely removed to facilitate transfers or allow closer approach to surfaces.

**CRITICAL NON-COVERED SCENARIO:** If the PRIMARY indication is desk/surface proximity for convenience (NOT medical necessity for transfers), this code is **NOT COVERED** by Medicare and requires **GY modifier**. Coverage is ONLY for transfer medical necessity.

**Key Features:**
- Swingaway (pivots to side) OR detachable (completely removes)
- Facilitates transfers by clearing space
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - bundled at initial wheelchair issue
- Billed per each footrest (not pair)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Covered:** Yes (with critical exceptions - see below)

**CRITICAL NON-COVERED SCENARIO:**
- **NOT COVERED** if primary indication is desk/surface proximity (convenience, not medical necessity)
- Use **GY modifier** when primary need is desk approach, NOT transfers
- Beneficiary may be financially responsible when GY modifier used

**Covered ONLY when medical necessity is for TRANSFERS:**
- Patient performs transfers (stand-pivot, slide board, etc.)
- Caregiver-assisted transfers requiring footrest removal
- Medical necessity for footrest removal during transfer process

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Medical necessity documentation** - Must document transfer needs, NOT just desk proximity
- **Transfer method documentation** - How patient transfers and why footrest removal medically necessary
- **KX modifier** when criteria met (medical necessity for transfers)
- **GY modifier** when NOT covered (desk proximity primary indication)

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Only with new power wheelchair *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** Bill per each footrest *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **BUNDLED at initial issue** - Fixed, swingaway, or detachable footrests INCLUDED in power wheelchair at initial
- **No separate billing at initial** - Only billable as replacement after initial wheelchair issue
- Bundled with wheelchair bases and elevating legrests at initial
- PT/OT not required
- RESNA ATP not required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** required
- **Medical necessity for swingaway/detachable function**
- **Transfer method documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** Bill per each footrest *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Standard feature included at initial
- Replacement covered
- Same requirements as K0044
- Home assessment not required for accessory alone

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Understanding the NON-COVERED Scenario

### Covered Scenario (Use KX Modifier):
**Medical necessity = TRANSFERS**
- Patient performs stand-pivot transfers and needs footrest to swing away for clearance
- Patient uses slide board transfers requiring footrest removal
- Caregiver performs assisted transfers needing footrest access
- Footrest removal medically necessary for safe transfer technique

**Documentation:** "Patient requires swingaway footrests for safe stand-pivot transfers. Patient stands from wheelchair and footrests must swing away to prevent tripping hazard during transfer. Medical necessity for transfer safety."

### NON-COVERED Scenario (Use GY Modifier):
**Primary indication = DESK/SURFACE PROXIMITY (Convenience)**
- Patient wants to pull closer to desk for work
- Desires to approach tables more closely for meals
- Convenience for approaching surfaces, NOT medical necessity
- Primary reason is proximity, NOT transfers

**Documentation (if GY used):** "Patient requests swingaway footrests primarily for desk proximity during work activities. Patient does not perform independent transfers. This is a convenience request, not medical necessity for transfers. Medicare non-covered per LCD. GY modifier applied. Beneficiary financially responsible."

### Key Decision Point:
**What is the PRIMARY indication?**
- **Transfers = Medical necessity** → Covered with KX modifier
- **Desk proximity = Convenience** → NOT covered, use GY modifier

## Footrest Type Comparison

### K0052 (Swingaway/Detachable)
- **Function:** Swings away OR completely removes
- **Use:** Facilitates transfers, allows surface approach
- **Billing:** Per each footrest
- **Critical:** Must be for transfer medical necessity (Medicare)

### K0050 (Fixed Legrest)
- **Function:** Fixed in position, does not remove
- **Use:** Standard support, no transfer needs
- **Billing:** Per each legrest
- **Use when:** Patient does NOT need footrest removal

### K0044 (Standard Footrest)
- **Function:** Basic footrest, may or may not be removable
- **Use:** Standard wheelchair footrest
- **Billing:** Various configurations

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0052 - Swingaway, detachable footrests, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] **Quantity:** Number of footrests needed (typically 2)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3, Z74.09)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Document PRIMARY medical necessity:**
  - [ ] **FOR TRANSFERS (covered):** Document transfer type and why footrest removal medically necessary
  - [ ] **FOR DESK PROXIMITY (NOT covered):** Document as convenience, apply GY modifier, inform beneficiary of financial responsibility
- [ ] **Transfer method documentation:**
  - [ ] Type of transfer (stand-pivot, slide board, assisted, etc.)
  - [ ] Why footrest removal is medically necessary for safe transfer
  - [ ] How footrest removal facilitates transfer
- [ ] **Modifier selection:**
  - [ ] KX modifier if medical necessity for transfers (covered)
  - [ ] GY modifier if primary indication is desk proximity (NOT covered)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document medical necessity for TRANSFERS, not desk proximity
- [ ] Transfer method and why footrest removal required
- [ ] Verify not billing at initial wheelchair issue (replacement only)

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Document medical necessity for swingaway/detachable function
- [ ] Transfer method documentation
- [ ] Verify replacement (not initial issue)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary"** - Vague or missing transfer documentation. Fix: Clearly document transfer type and why footrest removal is medically necessary. Example: "Patient performs slide board transfers from wheelchair to bed. Footrests must be removed to position slide board. Footrest removal medically necessary for safe transfer technique. Patient cannot transfer without footrest removal." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Billed at initial wheelchair issue"** - Cannot bill separately when bundled. Fix: K0052 is REPLACEMENT ONLY. Fixed, swingaway, or detachable footrests are INCLUDED in power wheelchair at initial issue. Only bill K0052 for replacement after initial. Verify date of initial wheelchair vs. replacement footrest order. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Primary indication is convenience, not medical necessity"** - Desk proximity documented as primary need. Fix: If primary need is transfers, clearly document transfer medical necessity FIRST and desk proximity as secondary benefit. If primary need truly is desk proximity (convenience), this is NOT covered - use GY modifier and inform beneficiary of financial responsibility. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Incorrect modifier"** - Missing KX or GY modifier. Fix: Use KX modifier when medical necessity criteria met (transfers). Use GY modifier when NOT covered (desk proximity primary indication). Document rationale for modifier choice. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document transfer medical necessity FIRST** - Make it clear primary indication is transfers *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Be specific about transfer type** - Stand-pivot, slide board, assisted, etc. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Explain why footrest removal is medically necessary** - Safety, clearance, positioning for transfer *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **If desk proximity is mentioned, make it secondary** - "Patient performs slide board transfers requiring footrest removal (primary need). Secondary benefit includes improved desk approach for ADLs." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Use correct modifier:** KX for covered (transfers), GY for non-covered (desk proximity)
- **Verify replacement timing** - Only bill for replacement, not at initial issue
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Document transfer method** - How patient transfers and why footrest removal needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Replacement only** - Verify not billing at initial wheelchair issue
- Fiscal order required
- Same requirements as K0044

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Transfer medical necessity:** "Patient requires swingaway footrests for [specific transfer type]. Footrest removal medically necessary for [specific reason: clearance, safety, positioning]. Patient transfers [frequency] and requires footrest removal each time."
- **If desk proximity mentioned:** "Secondary benefit of footrest removal includes improved surface approach for ADLs (meals, work), but PRIMARY medical necessity is for safe transfers."
- **Avoid convenience language:** Do NOT document as "patient prefers" or "patient requests for convenience" if seeking coverage. This triggers non-coverage.
