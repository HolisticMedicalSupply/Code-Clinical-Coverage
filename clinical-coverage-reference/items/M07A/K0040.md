# K0040 - Adjustable Angle Footplate

## Clinical Overview

K0040 represents an adjustable angle footplate for power wheelchairs. Footplate angle can be adjusted to accommodate ankle/foot contractures, AFO use, or other positioning needs requiring non-standard footplate angle. Standard footplates are fixed at 90-degree angle; K0040 allows angle adjustment forward (dorsiflexion) or backward (plantarflexion).

**Key Features:**
- Angle adjustable (forward or backward from neutral)
- Accommodates ankle/foot contractures
- Matches AFO angle requirements
- PT/OT evaluation recommended for angle measurement
- Included in some wheelchair packages

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

## Adjustable Angle Function

### Standard vs. Adjustable Footplate

**Standard Footplate:**
- Fixed angle (approximately 90 degrees - perpendicular to lower leg)
- Assumes normal ankle range of motion
- Adequate for patients without contractures or special positioning needs

**Adjustable Angle Footplate (K0040):**
- Angle can be adjusted forward (dorsiflexion) or backward (plantarflexion)
- Accommodates fixed ankle positions from contractures
- Matches AFO angle requirements
- Optimizes positioning when standard angle inadequate

### Angle Adjustment Directions

**Dorsiflexion angle (toes up):**
- Footplate tilted forward
- For dorsiflexion contractures
- For AFOs holding ankle in dorsiflexed position

**Plantarflexion angle (toes down):**
- Footplate tilted backward
- For plantarflexion contractures (most common)
- For AFOs holding ankle in plantarflexed position

## Clinical Indications

Adjustable angle footplate indicated for:

### Ankle/Foot Contractures
- **Plantarflexion contracture (M24.57):** Ankle stuck in toes-down position
- **Dorsiflexion contracture:** Ankle stuck in toes-up position
- **Fixed ankle deformity:** Cannot achieve neutral 90-degree position
- **Foot drop (M21.37):** Inability to dorsiflex foot
- Contractures from: cerebral palsy (G80.x), stroke (I69.34), spinal cord injury (G82.x), prolonged immobility

### AFO Use
- Patient wears ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) in wheelchair (Z97.16)
- AFO holds ankle at specific angle
- Footplate angle must match AFO angle for proper positioning
- Common with neurological conditions requiring bracing

### Hamstring Tightness
- Tight hamstrings limit knee extension (M25.57)
- Knee cannot reach full extension
- Altered knee angle affects optimal footplate angle
- Adjustable footplate optimizes foot positioning with flexed knee

### Positioning Requirements
- Special positioning protocols
- Therapeutic positioning needs
- Accommodation of lower extremity deformities

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0040 - Adjustable angle footplate, each"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (M24.57, M21.37, G82.x, G80.x, I69.34, Z97.16, M25.57)
- [ ] **Condition requiring non-standard footplate angle:**
  - [ ] Type (ankle contracture, AFO use, hamstring tightness, etc.)
  - [ ] Measurement of required ankle angle in degrees
  - [ ] Why standard 90-degree footplate inadequate
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation** (recommended) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] **Quantity:** 1 or 2 footplates based on need
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document contracture or positioning requirement
- [ ] Measurement of required ankle angle
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Document contracture or positioning needs with measurements
- [ ] PA may be required - check current guidelines

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Standard footplate adequate"** - Insufficient angle measurement documentation. Fix: Provide goniometric measurement: "Patient has plantarflexion contracture of left ankle. Goniometric measurement shows ankle fixed at 15 degrees plantarflexion from neutral. Cannot achieve neutral 90-degree ankle position. Adjustable angle footplate necessary to accommodate fixed ankle position at 15 degrees plantarflexion." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Vague positioning needs. Fix: Clearly document: "Patient has ankle contracture (M24.57) preventing neutral ankle position. Standard 90-degree footplate inadequate because ankle fixed at [X] degrees. Adjustable angle footplate medically necessary to accommodate contracture and provide proper foot support." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No PT/OT measurement"** - Missing professional assessment. Fix: While not required, PT/OT evaluation strengthens justification: "PT evaluation [date] documented goniometric ankle measurements: [X] degrees contracture. PT recommends adjustable angle footplate set at [Y] degrees to accommodate contracture and optimize positioning." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"AFO accommodation not documented"** - If AFO is reason. Fix: Document AFO details: "Patient wears [type] AFO holding ankle at [X] degrees [plantarflexion/dorsiflexion] (Z97.16). Standard footplate does not match AFO angle. Adjustable angle footplate necessary to match AFO angle and provide proper foot positioning." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Provide **specific angle measurements in degrees** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** - goniometric measurements strengthen claim *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **why standard 90-degree footplate inadequate** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **how adjustable angle improves positioning/function** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- Check **PA requirements** before ordering *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide **detailed measurements with contracture documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation helpful** for justification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document specific angle needed

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Condition:** "Patient has [ankle contracture M24.57 / foot drop M21.37 / AFO use Z97.16 / cerebral palsy with contractures G80.x]"
- **Angle measurement:** "[If contracture:] Goniometric measurement shows ankle fixed at [X] degrees [plantarflexion/dorsiflexion from neutral]. [If AFO:] Patient wears AFO holding ankle at [X] degrees"
- **Why adjustable needed:** "Standard 90-degree footplate inadequate because [ankle contracture prevents foot from resting flat / AFO angle does not match standard footplate / foot positioning uncomfortable with standard angle]. Adjustable angle footplate necessary to [accommodate fixed ankle position / match AFO angle / provide proper foot support]"
- **Required angle:** "Footplate angle must be adjusted to [X] degrees [forward/backward from standard] to accommodate [contracture/AFO] and provide proper positioning"
