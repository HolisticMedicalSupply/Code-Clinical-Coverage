# K0040 - Adjustable Angle Footplate

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Footplates - Angle Adjustable
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Adjustable angle footplate for power wheelchair. Footplate angle can be adjusted to accommodate ankle/foot contractures, AFO use, or other positioning needs requiring non-standard footplate angle. Standard footplates are fixed at 90-degree angle; K0040 allows angle adjustment.

## Adjustable Angle Function

### Standard vs. Adjustable Footplate

**Standard Footplate:**
- Fixed angle (approximately 90 degrees - perpendicular to lower leg)
- Assumes normal ankle range of motion
- Adequate for patients without contractures or special positioning needs

**Adjustable Angle Footplate (K0040):**
- Angle can be adjusted forward (dorsiflexion) or backward (plantarflexion)
- Accommodates fixed ankle positions from contractures
- Matches AFO angle requirements
- Optimizes positioning when standard angle inadequate

### Angle Adjustment Directions

**Dorsiflexion angle (toes up):**
- Footplate tilted forward
- For dorsiflexion contractures
- For AFOs holding ankle in dorsiflexed position

**Plantarflexion angle (toes down):**
- Footplate tilted backward
- For plantarflexion contractures (most common)
- For AFOs holding ankle in plantarflexed position

## Clinical Indications

Adjustable angle footplate indicated for:

### Ankle/Foot Contractures
- **Plantarflexion contracture (M24.57):** Ankle stuck in toes-down position
- **Dorsiflexion contracture:** Ankle stuck in toes-up position
- **Fixed ankle deformity:** Cannot achieve neutral 90-degree position
- **Foot drop (M21.37):** Inability to dorsiflex foot
- Contractures from: cerebral palsy (G80.x), stroke (I69.34), spinal cord injury (G82.x), prolonged immobility

### AFO Use
- Patient wears ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) in wheelchair (Z97.16)
- AFO holds ankle at specific angle
- Footplate angle must match AFO angle for proper positioning
- Common with neurological conditions requiring bracing

### Hamstring Tightness
- Tight hamstrings limit knee extension (M25.57)
- Knee cannot reach full extension
- Altered knee angle affects optimal footplate angle
- Adjustable footplate optimizes foot positioning with flexed knee

### Positioning Requirements
- Special positioning protocols
- Therapeutic positioning needs
- Accommodation of lower extremity deformities

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Specific condition requiring non-standard footplate angle
3. Measurement of required ankle angle (in degrees)
4. Why standard 90-degree footplate inadequate
5. How adjustable angle improves positioning/comfort/function

### Contracture Documentation

For contractures, document:
- **Type:** Plantarflexion, dorsiflexion, or other ankle deformity
- **Severity:** Angle measurement in degrees (goniometric measurement preferred)
- **Cause:** Cerebral palsy, stroke, SCI, immobility, etc.
- **Functional impact:** Cannot achieve neutral ankle position on standard footplate
- **Required angle:** Specific footplate angle needed to accommodate contracture

### AFO Documentation

For AFO use, document:
- **AFO type:** Solid AFO, hinged AFO, etc. (include HCPCS code if known)
- **AFO angle:** Angle AFO holds ankle (in degrees)
- **Footplate angle needed:** Footplate angle must match AFO angle
- **Why necessary:** Proper foot positioning requires footplate to match AFO angle

### PT/OT Evaluation

PT/OT evaluation recommended, should document:
- Goniometric measurement of ankle contracture or AFO angle
- Assessment of positioning with standard vs. adjustable footplate
- Determination of optimal footplate angle
- Professional recommendation for adjustable angle footplate

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue or when not included
- **RB modifier** for replacement orders

### Units
- Bill per each footplate
- Order quantity based on patient need:
  - 1 footplate (one foot requires angle adjustment)
  - 2 footplates (both feet require angle adjustment)

### When Billable

**At initial issue:**
- If NOT included in wheelchair package
- Document contracture/AFO at initial evaluation

**As replacement:**
- Original adjustable angle footplate damaged or worn
- RB modifier for replacement

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** May require PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Angle measurement critical:** Must document specific angle needed (in degrees)
2. **PT/OT recommended:** Evaluation with goniometric measurements strengthens justification
3. **Standard inadequate:** Must explain why standard 90-degree footplate insufficient
4. **AFO accommodation:** Document AFO type and angle if applicable
5. **Included in some packages:** May be included in complex rehab wheelchairs
6. **Per each footplate:** Order based on how many feet need angle adjustment (1 or 2)
7. **Face-to-face not required:** For accessory alone

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Condition requiring adjustable angle:** Patient has [ankle contracture M24.57 / foot drop M21.37 / AFO use Z97.16 / cerebral palsy with contractures G80.x / post-stroke with contractures I69.34] affecting ankle positioning.

**Ankle position/contracture:** [If contracture:] Patient has [plantarflexion/dorsiflexion] contracture of [left/right/bilateral] ankle. Goniometric measurement shows ankle fixed at [X] degrees [from neutral]. Patient cannot achieve neutral 90-degree ankle position. [If AFO:] Patient wears [type] AFO holding ankle at [X] degrees [of plantarflexion/dorsiflexion].

**Why adjustable angle needed:** Standard footplate at 90-degree angle inadequate because [ankle contracture prevents foot from resting flat on standard footplate / AFO angle does not match standard footplate angle / foot positioning uncomfortable and non-functional with standard angle]. Adjustable angle footplate necessary to [accommodate fixed ankle position / match AFO angle / provide proper foot support and positioning].

**Required footplate angle:** Footplate angle must be adjusted to [X] degrees [forward/backward from standard] to accommodate [contracture/AFO] and provide proper foot positioning.

**PT/OT evaluation:** [If available:] [PT/OT name] evaluated [date] and documented: [goniometric ankle measurements, contracture assessment, footplate angle recommendation]. Evaluation supports medical necessity for adjustable angle footplate.

[If at initial issue: Wheelchair configuration does not include adjustable angle footplates.] [If replacement: Original adjustable angle footplate damaged/worn requiring replacement. RB modifier for replacement.]

Recommend adjustable angle footplate, quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both]."
