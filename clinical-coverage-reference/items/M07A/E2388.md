# E2388 - Solid Foam Drive Wheel Tire

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Tire Replacements - Solid Foam
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Solid foam drive wheel tire for power wheelchair replacement. Tire manufactured as solid foam construction (not pneumatic tire filled with foam). Provides puncture-proof, maintenance-free operation with firm support. For rear (drive) wheels only.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2388** (solid foam): Manufactured as solid foam - puncture-proof, firm ride, maintenance-free
- **E2386** (foam-filled): Pneumatic tire filled with foam - puncture-proof, medium cushioning
- **E2381** (pneumatic): Air-filled tire - best cushioning, requires maintenance
- **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic): Most durable and firmest option
- **E2389** (solid foam caster): Same as E2388 but for front wheels

## Construction Differences

### E2388 (Solid Foam) vs. E2386 (Foam-Filled)
- **E2388:** Tire molded/manufactured as solid foam from start; no pneumatic tire casing; solid foam throughout
- **E2386:** Starts as pneumatic tire that is filled with liquid foam that hardens; retains pneumatic tire casing

### Ride Quality Comparison
1. **E2381** (pneumatic) - Softest ride, best shock absorption
2. **E2386** (foam-filled) - Medium cushioning, some shock absorption
3. **E2388** (solid foam) - Firm support, less cushioning
4. **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic) - Firmest ride, maximum durability

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Drive wheel tires worn or damaged beyond safe use
3. Tires not under manufacturer warranty
4. Medical necessity for solid foam vs. other tire types

### Justification for Solid Foam (E2388)
- Patient requires puncture-proof maintenance-free operation
- Firmer tire support appropriate for patient's weight/use pattern
- Use environment requires durable tire without maintenance needs
- Patient unable to maintain pneumatic or foam-filled tires
- Cost-effective puncture-proof alternative to foam-filled

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each tire
- Typically 2 units (both drive wheels)
- Specify tire size and solid foam construction

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Solid foam throughout:** Not a pneumatic tire - manufactured as solid foam from start
2. **Firmer ride:** Less cushioning than pneumatic (E2381) or foam-filled (E2386)
3. **Completely maintenance-free:** No air pressure checks, no flats, no repairs
4. **Weight consideration:** Solid foam tires add weight - may slightly reduce range
5. **Drive wheels only:** This code for rear (powered) wheels; use E2389 for front casters
6. **Warranty verification:** Confirm tires not under manufacturer warranty before ordering

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation]. Drive wheel tires worn [describe wear pattern/damage]. Tires not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Solid foam tires medically necessary due to [need for puncture-proof maintenance-free operation/firm support requirements/use environment]. Patient requires [durability/firm support/maintenance-free operation]. Solid foam construction appropriate for patient's [weight/use pattern/mobility needs]. Recommend replacement with solid foam drive wheel tires, size [specify], quantity 2 (both drive wheels)."
