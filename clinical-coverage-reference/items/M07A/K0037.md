# K0037 - High Mount Flip-Up Footrest

## Clinical Overview

K0037 represents a high mount flip-up footrest for power wheelchairs. The footrest can swing or flip out of the way to provide unobstructed front access for transfers. High mount design provides additional clearance compared to standard mount footrests. Most power wheelchairs come with flip-up footrests at initial issue, so this code is typically billed for replacement only.

**Key Features:**
- Flip-up mechanism - footrest swings out of way for transfers
- High mount design - mounted higher on frame for extra clearance
- Typically billed as replacement (included at initial issue)
- Facilitates slide transfers and stand-pivot transfers

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Medical necessity** for flip-up feature
- **Transfer method documentation** showing need for footrest to flip out of way *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **For replacement:** documentation of damage or wear

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for replacement accessory *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** As needed per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Included in wheelchair packages at initial issue
- Separately billable ONLY as replacement
- PT/OT not required; RESNA ATP not required
- KU modifier NOT applicable

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** required
- **Transfer needs documentation**
- **Home assessment** may be required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Prior Authorization:** YES - may be required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** As needed per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Stricter requirements than Medicare (PA and home assessment may apply)

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Flip-Up Footrest Function

### How Flip-Up Works
- **Normal position:** Footrest down, feet supported during wheelchair use
- **Transfer position:** Footrest flipped up/aside, front of wheelchair unobstructed
- **Operation:** Patient or caregiver flips footrest up before transfer, flips down after

### High Mount vs. Standard Mount
- **High mount (K0037):** Mounting point higher on wheelchair frame - more clearance for transfers
- **Standard mount:** Lower mounting point - may have less transfer clearance
- High mount design provides better foot clearance during stand-pivot transfers

## Transfer Applications

Flip-up footrest facilitates these transfer types:

### Slide Transfers
- Patient slides from wheelchair to bed, car seat, toilet, shower chair
- Fixed footrest would block sliding motion
- Footrest must flip out of way to allow sliding transfer path

### Stand-Pivot Transfers
- Patient stands from wheelchair and pivots to destination
- Fixed footrest in front would be barrier to standing
- Flipping footrest aside allows patient to position feet properly for standing

### Unobstructed Front Access
- Caregiver needs close access to patient for transfer assistance
- Fixed footrest blocks caregiver positioning
- Flip-up footrest allows caregiver to get closer for safe transfer

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0037 - High mount flip-up footrest, each"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z74.09, Z99.3, G82.20-G82.54, others as applicable)
- [ ] **Medical necessity for flip-up feature:**
  - [ ] Transfer type (slide, stand-pivot, assisted)
  - [ ] Transfer frequency (multiple times daily)
  - [ ] How fixed footrest would interfere with transfers
- [ ] **For replacement:** documentation of damage or wear
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document medical necessity for flip-up feature
- [ ] Transfer method documentation

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Transfer needs documentation
- [ ] Home assessment may be required - check current guidelines

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not separately billable at initial issue"** - Attempted to bill at wheelchair delivery. Fix: K0037 included in wheelchair packages. Only bill as replacement when original footrests damaged or worn. Document damage and need for replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Vague transfer needs. Fix: Clearly document specific transfer method: "Patient performs slide transfers from wheelchair to bed and car multiple times daily. Footrest must flip out of way to allow sliding transfer path. Fixed footrest would block transfer motion." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Insufficient transfer documentation"** - Unclear why flip-up needed. Fix: Document how fixed footrest would interfere: "Patient requires unobstructed front access for stand-pivot transfers. Fixed footrest creates barrier preventing patient from positioning feet properly for standing. Flip-up footrest necessary to clear transfer path." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"NY Medicaid PA not obtained"** - Missing prior authorization. Fix: Check current NY Medicaid guidelines. Obtain PA before ordering if required. Submit transfer documentation and medical necessity with PA request. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific transfer method and frequency** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **how fixed footrest would interfere** with patient's transfers *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **For replacement:** document damage, wear, or functional failure *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- Check **current PA requirements** before ordering *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide **detailed transfer needs documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment** may be required - verify with payer *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document why flip-up feature necessary for patient's transfer technique

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Transfer type:** "Patient performs [slide transfers/stand-pivot transfers/assisted transfers] [frequency: multiple times daily]"
- **Transfer destinations:** "Transfers to/from [bed/car/toilet/shower chair] require footrest to flip out of way"
- **Footrest interference:** "Fixed footrest would [block sliding transfer path/create barrier for standing/prevent proper foot positioning]"
- **For replacement:** "Original flip-up footrests [damaged/broken/worn]. [Describe: cracked/bent/mounting failed]. Affects [transfer safety/function]."
