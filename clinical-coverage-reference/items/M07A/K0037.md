# K0037 - High Mount Flip-Up Footrest

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Footrests - Flip-Up Design
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

High mount flip-up footrest for power wheelchair. Footrest can swing/flip out of the way to provide unobstructed front access for transfers. High mount design provides additional clearance. Included in most wheelchair packages at initial issue; typically billed as replacement only.

## Flip-Up Footrest Function

### How Flip-Up Works
- **Normal position:** Footrest down, feet supported during wheelchair use
- **Transfer position:** Footrest flipped up/aside, front of wheelchair unobstructed
- **Operation:** Patient or caregiver flips footrest up before transfer, flips down after

### High Mount vs. Standard Mount
- **High mount (K0037):** Mounting point higher on wheelchair frame - more clearance for transfers
- **Standard mount:** Lower mounting point - may have less transfer clearance
- High mount design provides better foot clearance during stand-pivot transfers

## Transfer Applications

Flip-up footrest facilitates these transfer types:

### Slide Transfers
- Patient slides from wheelchair to bed, car seat, toilet, shower chair
- Fixed footrest would block sliding motion
- Footrest must flip out of way to allow sliding transfer path

### Stand-Pivot Transfers
- Patient stands from wheelchair and pivots to destination
- Fixed footrest in front would be barrier to standing
- Flipping footrest aside allows patient to position feet properly for standing

### Assisted Transfers
- Caregiver needs close access to patient for transfer assistance
- Fixed footrest blocks caregiver positioning
- Flip-up footrest allows caregiver to get closer for safe transfer

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Patient performs transfers requiring footrest to flip out of way
3. Transfer method and frequency
4. How fixed footrest would interfere with transfer
5. For replacement: reasonable replacement as needed

### Transfer Documentation

Document transfer details:
- **Transfer type:** Slide transfer, stand-pivot transfer, assisted transfer
- **Transfer frequency:** Multiple times daily (bed, toilet, car, etc.)
- **Transfer destinations:** Bed, car, toilet, shower chair, furniture
- **Transfer assistance level:** Independent, assisted, dependent
- **Footrest interference:** Fixed footrest blocks transfer path, prevents standing, creates barrier

### Replacement Justification

For replacement orders, document:
- Original flip-up footrests damaged, broken, or worn
- Specific damage affecting function or safety
- Outside manufacturer warranty period
- Reasonable replacement based on useful lifetime

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue (included)
- **RB modifier** for replacement orders

### Units
- Bill per each footrest
- Typically order 2 units (left and right footrests)
- Can order 1 unit if only single footrest needs replacement

### When Billable

**At initial issue:**
- Generally NOT separately billable - included in wheelchair package

**As replacement:**
- Original footrests damaged, broken, or worn
- Reasonable replacement as needed
- RB modifier for replacement

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** YES - PA may be required

## NY Medicaid Special Requirements

**IMPORTANT for NY Medicaid:**
- **PA:** May be required (different from Medicare no-PA)
- **Home assessment:** YES - home assessment required
- **Documentation:** More extensive than Medicare requirements
- Contact NY Medicaid for specific PA requirements before ordering

## Special Considerations

1. **Included at initial:** Flip-up footrests standard feature - included with wheelchair
2. **Replacement billing:** Typically billed only as replacement, not at initial issue
3. **Transfer-focused:** Primary benefit is facilitating transfers
4. **High mount design:** Provides additional clearance compared to standard mount
5. **Typically pair:** Order both footrests (2 units) for consistency
6. **NY Medicaid stricter:** PA and home assessment may be required (vs. Medicare no PA)
7. **Face-to-face not required:** For replacement accessory
8. **Related components:** Footplates (K0040-K0042) and extension tubes (K0043) separate

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Transfer method:** Patient performs [independent/assisted] [slide transfers/stand-pivot transfers/combination] [frequency: multiple times daily] to/from wheelchair to [bed/car/toilet/shower chair/etc.].

**Footrest necessity:** Flip-up footrest feature necessary to [allow sliding transfer path/remove barrier for standing/provide caregiver access for assisted transfer]. Fixed footrest would [block transfer path/prevent proper foot positioning for standing/create safety hazard during transfer].

**Transfer frequency and importance:** Patient transfers [X times per day] for [activities of daily living/toileting/bed mobility/vehicle access]. Transfers are [critical for independence/required for medical needs/essential for safety].

[If replacement:] Original flip-up footrests [damaged/broken/worn] requiring replacement. [Describe specific damage: bent hanger bracket/cracked footplate/worn mounting mechanism/etc.]. Footrest damage affects [transfer safety/footrest function/patient safety]. Not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Reasonable replacement based on [useful lifetime/damage beyond repair].

[NY Medicaid specific:] Home assessment completed [date] documenting transfer needs and wheelchair setup. PA [requested/approved] per NY Medicaid policy.
