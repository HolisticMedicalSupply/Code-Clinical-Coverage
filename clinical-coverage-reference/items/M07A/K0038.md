# K0038 - Leg Strap

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Leg Positioning and Safety
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Standard leg strap for power wheelchair. Secures lower leg to footrest to prevent feet from sliding off during wheelchair use. Provides stabilization for patients with spasticity, involuntary movements, or leg weakness. For severe spasticity, see K0039 (H-style leg strap).

## Leg Strap Function

### Purpose
Leg strap:
- Secures lower leg (typically calf area) to footrest
- Prevents feet from sliding off footrests
- Maintains proper foot positioning during wheelchair use
- Provides safety and stability

### Design
- **Standard strap (K0038):** Single strap wrapping around calf
- **Attachment:** Connects to footrest or wheelchair frame
- **Material:** Typically padded nylon or similar with hook-and-loop closure
- **Adjustable:** Can tighten/loosen for comfort and security

## K0038 vs. K0039 (Standard vs. H-Style)

### K0038 (Standard Leg Strap)
- **Design:** Single strap around calf
- **Use for:** Mild to moderate stabilization needs
- **Spasticity level:** Standard spasticity, moderate involuntary movements
- **When adequate:** Typical leg stabilization requirements

### K0039 (H-Style Leg Strap)
- **Design:** H-shaped configuration (enhanced stabilization)
- **Use for:** Severe spasticity requiring enhanced control
- **Spasticity level:** Severe spasticity, strong extensor patterns
- **When needed:** Standard leg strap (K0038) proves insufficient

**Selection:** Start with K0038 (standard). Only use K0039 if K0038 insufficient for patient's spasticity severity.

## Clinical Indications

Leg strap indicated for patients with:

### Spasticity
- Cerebral palsy (G80.x)
- Multiple sclerosis (G35)
- Spinal cord injury with spasticity (G82.x)
- Involuntary muscle contractions causing leg extension/movement

### Involuntary Movements
- Chorea, athetosis, dyskinesias (R25.2)
- Legs move involuntarily, feet slide off footrests
- Cannot voluntarily control leg position

### Weakness
- Lower extremity weakness (M62.81)
- Unable to maintain foot position independently
- Legs slip due to lack of muscle control

### Safety Concerns
- Feet sliding off footrests creating fall/injury risk
- Foot dragging risk during wheelchair operation
- Toe/foot entrapment risk in wheelchair mechanism

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Specific condition causing need for leg stabilization
3. How condition affects foot positioning (feet slide off, involuntary movements, etc.)
4. Safety concerns without leg strap
5. May be included at initial issue or replacement

### Clinical Documentation

Document:
- **Diagnosis:** Specific condition (spasticity, involuntary movements, weakness)
- **Functional impact:** Feet slide off footrests, cannot maintain position, legs extend involuntarily
- **Safety issue:** Foot injury risk, dragging risk, entrapment risk without leg strap
- **Frequency:** How often feet slide off or positioning problem occurs
- **Severity:** Mild, moderate (K0038 adequate) vs. severe (may need K0039)

### Replacement Documentation

For replacement orders:
- Original leg strap worn, frayed, stretched out, or damaged
- Describe specific wear (elastic stretched, material frayed, attachment points broken)
- Replacement needed for continued safe wheelchair use

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue or when not included
- **RB modifier** for replacement orders

### Units
- Bill per each leg strap
- Order quantity based on patient need:
  - 1 strap (single leg if only one leg requires stabilization)
  - 2 straps (both legs require stabilization)

### When Billable

**At initial issue:**
- If NOT included in wheelchair package
- Document medical necessity at initial evaluation

**As replacement:**
- Original leg strap worn or damaged
- RB modifier for replacement
- Replacement based on wear

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA (not required for leg straps alone)

## Special Considerations

1. **Standard design:** K0038 for typical stabilization - see K0039 for severe spasticity
2. **May be included:** Some wheelchairs include leg straps at initial issue
3. **Replacement item:** Subject to wear from repeated use - billable as replacement
4. **Safety device:** Prevents foot injury, dragging, entrapment risks
5. **Face-to-face not required:** For accessory alone
6. **PT/OT not required:** But evaluation helpful for severe cases
7. **Adjustable fit:** Can adjust tightness for comfort and effectiveness

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Diagnosis:** Patient has [cerebral palsy with spasticity G80.x / multiple sclerosis with spasticity G35 / spinal cord injury with spasticity G82.x / lower extremity weakness M62.81 / involuntary movements R25.2].

**Functional impact:** Patient experiences [involuntary leg movements / spasticity causing leg extension / lower extremity weakness] resulting in feet sliding off footrests during wheelchair use. [Describe frequency: feet slide off multiple times per day / legs extend involuntarily throughout day / cannot maintain foot position independently].

**Safety concerns:** Without leg strap, patient at risk for [foot injury from dragging on ground / toe entrapment in wheelchair mechanism / loss of stability / fall risk]. Leg strap necessary to maintain safe foot positioning on footrests.

**Severity:** [Mild to moderate spasticity/movements - standard leg strap (K0038) appropriate] OR [if severe: Severe spasticity requiring enhanced stabilization - see K0039 (H-style) order].

[If at initial issue: Wheelchair configuration does not include leg straps - separately billing for medical necessity.] [If replacement: Original leg strap worn/damaged [describe: frayed material/stretched elastic/broken attachment/etc.] requiring replacement for continued safe use. RB modifier for replacement.]

Recommend leg strap, quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both legs]."
