# E2389 - Solid Foam Caster Tire

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Tire Replacements - Solid Foam
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Solid foam caster tire for power wheelchair replacement. Tire manufactured as solid foam construction (not pneumatic tire filled with foam). Provides puncture-proof, maintenance-free operation with firm support. For front (caster) wheels only. Same construction as E2388 but for front wheels instead of rear drive wheels.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2389** (solid foam caster): Manufactured as solid foam - puncture-proof, firm ride, front wheels
- **E2388** (solid foam drive): Same construction but for rear drive wheels
- **E2387** (foam-filled caster): Pneumatic caster tire filled with foam - medium cushioning
- **E2384** (pneumatic caster): Air-filled caster tire - best cushioning, requires maintenance
- **E2391/E2392** (solid rubber/plastic caster): Most durable and firmest options

## Construction Details

### E2389 (Solid Foam) vs. E2387 (Foam-Filled)
- **E2389:** Tire molded/manufactured as solid foam from start; no pneumatic tire casing
- **E2387:** Starts as pneumatic tire filled with foam; retains pneumatic tire casing

### Caster Tire Firmness Comparison
1. **E2384** (pneumatic) - Softest ride, best shock absorption
2. **E2387** (foam-filled) - Medium cushioning
3. **E2389** (solid foam) - Firm support
4. **E2391/E2392** (solid rubber/plastic) - Firmest, most durable

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document (Same as E2388)
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Front caster tires worn or damaged beyond safe use
3. Tires not under manufacturer warranty
4. Medical necessity for solid foam vs. other tire types

### Justification for Solid Foam Casters
- Patient requires puncture-proof maintenance-free operation
- Consistency with drive wheel tire selection (if using solid foam drive wheels E2388)
- Use environment requires durable tire without maintenance
- Cost-effective puncture-proof alternative

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each tire
- Typically 2 units (both front casters)
- Specify tire size and solid foam construction

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Same as E2388:** All requirements identical to E2388; only difference is wheel position (front vs. rear)
2. **Caster wheels:** Front wheels that swivel for steering - typically smaller than drive wheels
3. **Solid foam throughout:** Not pneumatic tire - manufactured as solid foam from start
4. **Completely maintenance-free:** No air pressure checks, no flats, no repairs
5. **Typically matched:** If using solid foam drive wheels (E2388), usually use solid foam casters (E2389)
6. **Warranty verification:** Confirm tires not under manufacturer warranty before ordering

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation]. Front caster tires worn [describe wear pattern/damage]. Tires not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Solid foam caster tires medically necessary due to [need for puncture-proof maintenance-free operation/consistency with drive wheel selection/use environment]. Patient requires [durability/firm support/maintenance-free operation]. Solid foam construction appropriate for patient's mobility needs. Recommend replacement with solid foam caster tires, size [specify], quantity 2 (both front casters)."
