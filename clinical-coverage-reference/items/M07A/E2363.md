# E2363 - Group 22NF Sealed Lead Acid Battery

## Clinical Overview

E2363 represents Group 22NF sealed lead acid batteries for power wheelchairs. Group 22NF is a specific battery size used in certain power wheelchair models. "NF" refers to narrow format. Same coverage requirements as E2359 (Group 27 sealed) - only difference is battery size.

**CRITICAL:** **ONLY SEALED batteries covered.** Non-sealed batteries (E2364) are DENIED per LCD L33792.

**Key Features:**
- Group 22NF battery size (specific models)
- "NF" = Narrow Format
- Physical dimensions: approx. 9.5" L x 6.9" W x 8.3" H
- SEALED lead acid type: gel cell OR absorbed glass mat (AGM)
- Maintenance-free
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time per LCD L33792

## Coverage Details

**Same coverage as E2359 (Group 27 sealed) - all requirements identical except battery size.**

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (sealed batteries only)

**All requirements same as E2359:**
- SWO required
- NO PA
- NO face-to-face required for battery replacement
- Documentation power wheelchair meets coverage criteria
- Proof outside warranty
- Battery specifications (Group 22NF sealed)
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time per LCD L33792

### NY Medicaid

**Covered:** Yes (sealed batteries only)

**All requirements same as E2359:**
- Fiscal order
- Documentation wheelchair meets WME criteria
- Proof outside warranty
- May require PA depending on frequency
- Delivery within 30 days
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time

## Prescription Checklist

**Same as E2359 except:**
- [ ] Specify battery size: **Group 22NF** (not Group 24 or Group 27)
- [ ] Verify wheelchair uses Group 22NF size (check wheelchair manual/specification)

**All other requirements identical to E2359.**

## Common Denial Reasons

**Same as E2359 plus:**

**"Wrong battery size"** - Must match wheelchair specification. Fix: "Patient's power wheelchair (K0841) requires Group 22NF batteries per manufacturer specification; ordering 2 units E2363 (Group 22NF sealed, gel cell type) matching wheelchair battery compartment size."

## Tips for Approval

**Same as E2359 - all tips identical.**

Key points:
- Document wheelchair outside warranty
- ONLY sealed batteries (gel cell or absorbed glass mat)
- Up to 2 batteries maximum
- Battery wear/diminished capacity documented
- **Verify correct battery size** (Group 22NF for this code)

## Related Codes

- **E2361** - Group 24 sealed
- **E2363** - Group 22NF sealed (this code)
- **E2365** - U-1 sealed
- **E2371** - Group 24 sealed deep cycle
- **K0733** - Group 34 sealed

**NOT COVERED - Non-Sealed (DO NOT USE):**

**Charger:**
- **E2366** - Single mode battery charger (for sealed batteries)

## Battery Size Information

**Group 22NF** (E2363) - This code:
- Specific size for certain wheelchair models
- "NF" = Narrow Format
- Physical dimensions: approx. 9.5" L x 6.9" W x 8.3" H
- Less common than Group 24/27 but used in specific configurations

**Check wheelchair specification** to determine if Group 22NF required. Not all wheelchairs use this size.
