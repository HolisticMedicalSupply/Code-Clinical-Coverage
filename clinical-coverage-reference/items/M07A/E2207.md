# E2207 - Crutch and Cane Holder

## Clinical Overview

E2207 represents a crutch and cane holder accessory for wheelchairs. This accessory provides secure storage for ambulatory aids (crutches, canes, walkers) while the patient is using the wheelchair. Designed for patients with dual mobility patterns who use both wheelchair for longer distances and ambulatory aids for short distances or specific activities.

**Key Features:**
- Securely holds crutches, canes, or walkers
- Mounted to wheelchair frame
- Allows patient to carry ambulatory aids with wheelchair
- Facilitates independent transitions between wheelchair and ambulation
- Prevents loss or damage to ambulatory aids
- Can be used with manual or power wheelchairs

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Limited community ambulator: uses wheelchair for community/long distances, cane/walker for household/short distances
- Hemiplegia patient: uses wheelchair for energy conservation, cane for short-distance ambulation
- Arthritis patient: uses wheelchair for pain management during long outings, cane for short distances
- Progressive condition: uses wheelchair increasingly but still ambulates short distances with aids

- [ ] Explanation of mobility pattern

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Documentation of ambulation pattern

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient doesn't use ambulatory aids"** - No documentation of dual mobility pattern. Fix: Document that patient uses BOTH wheelchair AND ambulatory aids: "Patient uses manual wheelchair for community mobility and distances >100 feet; uses rolling walker for household mobility and distances <100 feet; patient transfers from wheelchair to walker for bathroom, kitchen activities; requires crutch/cane holder to transport walker with wheelchair during community outings; without holder, patient unable to bring walker for indoor mobility at destinations; crutch/cane holder medically necessary for independent dual-mode mobility."

2. **"Convenience item"** - Perceived as convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: Link to functional independence and safety: "Patient with bilateral knee OA; uses power wheelchair for pain management during community outings (cannot walk >100 feet without severe pain); uses quad cane for household mobility and short transfers; patient lives alone; requires both mobility aids for independence; without cane holder on wheelchair, patient cannot transport cane to destinations creating unsafe transfer situations; cane holder medically necessary for safe independent mobility and transfers during community activities."

3. **"Mobility pattern unclear"** - Vague description of when patient uses each mobility mode. Fix: Provide specific mobility pattern: "Patient's mobility pattern: (1) Manual wheelchair for all outdoor/community mobility including shopping, medical appointments, social activities. (2) Bilateral forearm crutches for indoor mobility at home and short distances (<50 feet) at destinations. Patient requires wheelchair to access community but uses crutches for maneuvering in tight indoor spaces (bathrooms, small stores). Crutch holder necessary to transport crutches with wheelchair for dual-mode community access."

4. **"Ambulatory aids not medically necessary"** - Question whether patient needs ambulatory aids if using wheelchair. Fix: Explain dual mobility medical necessity: "Patient with progressive MS; uses power wheelchair as primary mobility due to fatigue and balance impairment; however, PT recommends continued ambulation with rolling walker for short distances to maintain strength and bone density; patient walks with walker 50-100 feet 2-3x daily per therapy recommendations; uses wheelchair for all other mobility; walker holder necessary to transport walker with wheelchair for continued therapeutic ambulation during community outings."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document dual mobility pattern clearly** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Specify ambulatory aids used** (crutches, cane type, walker type) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Explain when uses wheelchair vs. when uses ambulatory aids** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Link to independence and safety** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Simple accessory - minimal documentation required

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Brief mobility pattern documentation** adequate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Medical necessity statement** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Generally no PA for minor accessories

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Limited community ambulator**: "Patient uses manual wheelchair for community mobility >200 feet due to severe bilateral knee osteoarthritis limiting walking tolerance; uses quad cane for household mobility <200 feet and bathroom transfers; patient shops, attends medical appointments, visits family using wheelchair; requires cane at destinations for indoor mobility in tight spaces; crutch/cane holder medically necessary to transport quad cane with wheelchair for safe independent mobility during community activities; without holder, patient cannot bring cane creating unsafe transfer situations at destinations"

- **Hemiplegia dual mobility**: "Patient with left hemiplegia from CVA; uses power wheelchair for primary mobility due to left-sided weakness and limited endurance; uses single-point cane in right hand for short-distance ambulation (bed to bathroom, kitchen to table) totaling 10-20 feet; PT recommends continued short-distance ambulation for functional maintenance; patient requires wheelchair for community access but needs cane available for short indoor walks; crutch/cane holder medically necessary to transport cane with wheelchair for dual-mode functional mobility"

- **Progressive condition**: "Patient with Parkinson's disease; uses manual wheelchair for community and outdoor mobility due to gait instability and fall risk; uses rolling walker with seat for indoor mobility at home and short distances with frequent rest; disease progression requires increasing wheelchair use but PT recommends maintaining ambulation capacity; walker holder medically necessary to transport walker with wheelchair allowing patient to use walker for appropriate short-distance ambulation while relying on wheelchair for safety during longer distances"

- **Energy conservation**: "Patient with CHF and COPD; uses power wheelchair for energy conservation during community activities (shopping, medical appointments); uses rolling walker for household mobility when oxygen saturation permits; cardiac rehab recommends wheelchair use for >100 feet to prevent cardiac stress while maintaining short-distance ambulation for conditioning; walker holder necessary to transport walker with wheelchair during community outings allowing patient to ambulate short distances at destinations per cardiac protocol"
