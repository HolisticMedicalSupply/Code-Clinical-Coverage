# E1028 - Manual Swingaway Mounting Hardware (Joystick/Control)

## Clinical Overview

E1028 represents manual swingaway, retractable, or removable mounting hardware for joystick, other control interface, or positioning accessory on power wheelchairs. This mounting hardware allows the control to be manually moved out of the way during transfers and then repositioned for driving. Unlike fixed mounting, swingaway mounting facilitates side transfers by moving the control interface out of the transfer path.

**Key Features:**
- Manual swingaway, retractable, or removable design
- Allows control to be moved out of way during transfers
- Can be repositioned for optimal driving access
- Typically used with power wheelchair joysticks
- May also be used for other control interfaces (head arrays, chin controls) or positioning accessories

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- SCI patient performing slide board transfers requiring joystick to be moved out of transfer path
- Caregiver-assisted transfers where joystick obstructs transfer
- Patient needing variable joystick positioning throughout day (closer for driving, moved back for desk work)
- Power wheelchair user requiring joystick removal for specific activities

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E1028 - Manual swingaway mounting hardware for joystick/control"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 wheelchair dependence, G82.x SCI, etc.)
- [ ] **Functional need for swingaway mounting:**
  - [ ] Transfers requiring control to be moved out of way
  - [ ] Joystick obstructs slide board or caregiver-assisted transfers
  - [ ] Variable positioning needs throughout day
  - [ ] Specific activities requiring control removal
- [ ] **Justification for swingaway vs. fixed mounting:**
  - [ ] Why fixed mounting inadequate
  - [ ] Transfer safety/feasibility issues with fixed mount
  - [ ] Positioning benefits of adjustable mount
- [ ] **Transfer assessment:**
  - [ ] Type of transfers (slide board, caregiver-assisted, etc.)
  - [ ] How joystick interferes with current fixed mount
  - [ ] How swingaway mounting will facilitate transfers
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation recommended** (positioning and transfer assessment)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Medical necessity for swingaway mounting
- [ ] Functional need for movable control
- [ ] Transfer assessment
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Justification for swingaway vs. fixed mount
- [ ] Transfer needs documented
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended
- [ ] May need PA - check with DVS/eMedNY

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Fixed mounting adequate"** - Insufficient justification for swingaway. Fix: Document specific transfer issues with fixed mounting: "Patient with T6 SCI performs independent slide board transfers from power wheelchair to bed/car; current fixed joystick mounting obstructs slide board placement creating unsafe transfer; patient must lean around joystick creating fall risk; swingaway mounting medically necessary to move joystick out of transfer path for safe transfers."

2. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Vague justification for swingaway vs. fixed. Fix: Provide specific functional limitations with fixed mount: "Patient's fixed-mount joystick positioned at right armrest for driving access; this position blocks right-side transfers which are patient's only feasible transfer direction (left hemiplegia); swingaway mounting allows joystick to be moved out of way for transfers then repositioned for driving; medically necessary for safe independent transfers."

3. **"Convenience item"** - Perceived as convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: Link swingaway need to medical diagnosis and functional impairment: "Patient with high SCI has limited trunk control; caregiver-assisted transfers required; fixed joystick mounting obstructs caregiver access during transfers creating risk of skin tears and unsafe lifts; swingaway mounting medically necessary for safe caregiver transfers without skin injury risk."

4. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** (especially Medicaid) - Missing positioning and transfer assessment. Fix: While not required for Medicare, PT/OT evaluation significantly strengthens justification. Should document: current transfer method, how fixed mount interferes with transfers, trial of swingaway mounting successful, safety benefits of swingaway mounting.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific transfer issues** with fixed mounting *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **why fixed mounting cannot meet transfer needs** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** - strengthens justification *(Under Review)*
- Link to **safety concerns** with fixed mount *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May be included in complex rehab wheelchair packages

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Justification for swingaway vs. fixed** mounting critical *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** for transfer assessment *(Under Review)*
- **Transfer safety documentation** supports medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May require PA - check first

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Transfer safety**: "Patient with T10 SCI performs independent slide board transfers; current fixed joystick mount at right armrest obstructs slide board placement; patient must lean around joystick creating trunk instability and fall risk during transfers; swingaway mounting medically necessary to move joystick out of transfer path; patient can swing joystick away before transfer then reposition after transfer for safe independent mobility"
- **Caregiver transfer**: "Patient with C4 complete SCI; caregiver-assisted transfers required; fixed joystick mounting obstructs caregiver positioning during transfers; caregiver must reach around/over joystick creating awkward body mechanics and risk of damaging joystick; swingaway mounting allows joystick to be moved out of way for safe caregiver access during transfers"
- **Variable positioning**: "Patient requires close joystick positioning (6 inches from midline) for optimal driving control; this position obstructs desk access for employment; patient requires joystick to be moved back (12 inches) for desk clearance; swingaway mounting allows position adjustment for both driving and desk work; medically necessary for employment access"
- **PT/OT assessment**: "PT evaluation 10/25/2025: Patient performs slide board transfers independently; fixed joystick mount observed to obstruct transfer path; patient leans around joystick with trunk rotation creating instability; trial of swingaway mounting successful; patient able to swing joystick out of way, complete safe transfer, reposition joystick for driving; swingaway mounting medically necessary for safe independent transfers"

## Related Codes

- **E1028** - Manual swingaway mounting hardware (this code)
- **E2321** - Power wheelchair accessory, hand control interface - control interface itself
- **E2330** - Power wheelchair accessory, head control interface - alternative control
- **K0108** - Wheelchair component/accessory NOS

**Note:** E1028 is the MOUNTING HARDWARE (swingaway mount), not the control interface itself. The joystick/control interface is billed separately. E1028 is just the mounting system that allows the control to be moved.
