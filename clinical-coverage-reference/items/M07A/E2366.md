# E2366 - Single Mode Battery Charger

## Clinical Overview

E2366 represents a single mode battery charger for power wheelchair batteries. "Single mode" means charger designed for one battery type (sealed lead acid batteries). Since only sealed batteries covered per LCD L33792, single mode charger is appropriate and adequate.

**Key Features:**
- Single mode (designed for one battery type)
- Appropriate for sealed lead acid batteries
- Replacement only (charger included with initial wheelchair)
- Typically one charger per wheelchair
- Must be outside warranty period

## Coverage Details

## Prescription Checklist

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E2366 - Battery charger, single mode"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 wheelchair dependence)
- [ ] **Power wheelchair documentation:**
  - [ ] Which power wheelchair patient has
  - [ ] Power wheelchair meets coverage criteria
- [ ] **Battery type:** Sealed lead acid (gel cell or absorbed glass mat)
- [ ] **Charger condition:**
  - [ ] Charger damaged, lost, or failed
  - [ ] Why replacement needed
  - [ ] How charger failure affects wheelchair use
- [ ] **Warranty status:**
  - [ ] Wheelchair/charger age
  - [ ] Statement NOT covered under warranty
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Written order for charger replacement
- [ ] Documentation of power wheelchair
- [ ] Battery type specification (sealed lead acid)
- [ ] Proof not covered under warranty

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Documentation of need
- [ ] Not under warranty

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Under warranty"** - Charger should be covered by wheelchair warranty. Fix: Document wheelchair outside warranty period: "Patient's power wheelchair purchased 2 years ago; standard warranty expired; charger failed outside warranty period; replacement charger not covered under warranty; E2366 medically necessary for wheelchair operation."

2. **"Dual mode ordered"** - E2367 (dual mode) billed instead of E2366 (single mode). Fix: E2367 DENIED for replacements. Use E2366 (single mode): "Order single mode battery charger (E2366) for sealed lead acid batteries; patient uses sealed batteries (E2359); single mode charger appropriate per LCD L33792."

3. **"Charger failure not documented"** - Missing description of problem. Fix: Document charger problem: "Patient's power wheelchair battery charger stopped functioning; charger will not charge batteries; tested with multimeter shows no output; wheelchair batteries not charging creating mobility limitation; replacement charger medically necessary for continued wheelchair use."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document charger failure/damage** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Proof outside warranty** (wheelchair age) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Battery type: sealed lead acid** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Simple replacement** - minimal documentation

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Document need** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Outside warranty** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Generally no PA** for charger replacement

## Single Mode vs Dual Mode Chargers

**E2366 - Single Mode:**
- Charges ONE battery type (sealed batteries)
- Appropriate for sealed lead acid batteries
- **COVERED** for replacements
- Adequate since only sealed batteries covered

**E2367 - Dual Mode:**
- Charges EITHER sealed OR non-sealed batteries
- **DENIED for replacements** per LCD L33792
- Unnecessary since only sealed batteries covered
- Use E2366 (single mode) instead
