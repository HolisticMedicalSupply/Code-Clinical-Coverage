# E0985 - Seat Lift Mechanism (NOT COVERED for Wheelchairs)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE: NOT COVERED UNDER WHEELCHAIR LCD

**E0985 is NOT COVERED as a wheelchair accessory.**

This code is for seat lift mechanisms on CHAIRS (not wheelchairs) and is covered under a separate LCD.

## Correct Code for Power Wheelchair Seat Elevation

**For power wheelchair seat elevation, use:**
- **E2300** - Wheelchair accessory, power seat elevation system, any type

E2300 is the correct code for power seat elevation on complex rehab power wheelchairs.

## Why E0985 is Not Covered for Wheelchairs

### Medicare

**NOT COVERED** under wheelchair LCD L33792

E0985 is specifically for seat lift mechanisms on CHAIRS (e.g., lift chairs for standing assistance), NOT for power wheelchair seat elevation systems.

**What happens if you bill E0985 with wheelchair codes:**
- Claim will be **DENIED**
- Denial reason: "Not covered under wheelchair LCD"
- Must use E2300 for power wheelchair seat elevation

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**NOT COVERED** as wheelchair accessory

Same as Medicare - E0985 is for seat lift chairs, not wheelchair seat elevation.

**Use E2300** for power wheelchair seat elevation with complex rehab power wheelchairs.

## Common Billing Error

**INCORRECT:**
- Billing E0985 for power wheelchair seat elevation
- **Result**: DENIED - not covered under wheelchair LCD

**CORRECT:**
- Billing E2300 for power wheelchair seat elevation
- **Result**: May be covered with complex rehab power wheelchair and medical necessity documentation

## E0985 vs E2300 Comparison

| Code | Description | Covered for Wheelchairs? | Use For |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|---------|
| **E0985** | Seat lift mechanism | ❌ NO | Seat lift CHAIRS (separate LCD) |
| **E2300** | Power seat elevation system | ✅ YES | Power wheelchair seat elevation |

## Correct Billing for Wheelchair Seat Elevation

**If patient needs power wheelchair with seat elevation:**

1. **Base power wheelchair code:**
   - K0830 - Group 2 PWC with seat elevator, sling/solid seat (≤300 lbs)
   - K0831 - Group 2 PWC with seat elevator, captain's chair (≤300 lbs)

2. **OR base power wheelchair + seat elevation accessory:**
   - K0820-K0829 (Group 2 power wheelchair base)
   - **PLUS E2300** (power seat elevation system accessory)

**Do NOT use E0985** - it will be denied.

## References

- Medicare LCD L33792 (Wheelchair Options/Accessories) - E0985 NOT covered
- Medicare LCD for Seat Lift Mechanisms (separate LCD for chairs, not wheelchairs)
- E2300 is the correct code for power wheelchair seat elevation
- Source document: M07A.md (lines 107-111)

## Summary

**E0985 = NOT COVERED for wheelchairs**

**Use E2300 for power wheelchair seat elevation**

Billing E0985 as wheelchair accessory will result in automatic denial.
