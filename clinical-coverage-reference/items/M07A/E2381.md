# E2381 - Pneumatic Drive Wheel Tire (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E2381 represents replacement pneumatic drive wheel tires for power wheelchairs. Pneumatic = air-filled tires (like car tires). Drive wheels are main propulsion wheels (typically 2). For REPLACEMENT only when tires worn/damaged. Must justify pneumatic vs. solid tires.

**Key Features:**
- Pneumatic (air-filled) tires
- For drive wheels (main propulsion wheels)
- Replacement only
- Any size
- Bill per each tire (typically need 2)
- RB modifier required
- Must be outside warranty period

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Covered. SWO required. NO PA. RB modifier. Bill per each tire (typically 2). Justify pneumatic vs. solid tires.

### NY Medicaid: Covered. Generally no PA. Fiscal order. Warranty status. Bill per each tire.

## Prescription Checklist

**Required:**
- [ ] **E2381 - Pneumatic drive wheel tire, each**
- [ ] **RB modifier**
- [ ] Quantity (typically 2 tires for 2 drive wheels)
- [ ] Tire worn/damaged
- [ ] Outside warranty
- [ ] **Justify pneumatic vs. solid tires** (ride quality, outdoor use, shock absorption)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Under warranty"** - Fix: Document wheelchair outside warranty.
2. **"No justification for pneumatic"** - Fix: "Patient uses wheelchair outdoors on rough terrain; pneumatic tires provide shock absorption and better traction on uneven surfaces; solid tires inadequate for patient's outdoor use conditions."
3. **"No RB modifier"** - Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier.

## Tips for Approval

- Document tire wear/damage
- Proof outside warranty
- RB modifier REQUIRED
- Justify pneumatic vs. solid tires
- Bill per each tire (typically 2)
