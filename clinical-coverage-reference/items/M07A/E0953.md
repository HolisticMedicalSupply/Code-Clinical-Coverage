# E0953 - Lateral Thigh/Knee Support (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E0953 represents a lateral thigh or knee support accessory providing lateral stabilization for the lower extremities. This positioning device addresses postural asymmetries, hip adduction/abduction abnormalities, pelvic obliquity, and spasticity that create lateral leg instability. The support maintains proper lower extremity alignment and prevents windswept deformity.

**CRITICAL**: This is a **REPLACEMENT-ONLY** code. Lateral thigh/knee supports are included in the wheelchair base at initial delivery and can only be billed separately as replacements.

**Key Features:**
- Lateral support for thigh or knee positioning
- Prevents windswept deformity
- Addresses hip adduction/abduction abnormalities
- Maintains lower extremity alignment
- Includes fixed mounting hardware
- Typically positioned on one or both sides as needed

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Cerebral palsy patient with windswept deformity from asymmetric hip muscle tone
- SCI patient with pelvic obliquity requiring lateral leg support
- Patient with scoliosis and associated pelvic/lower extremity asymmetry
- Hemiplegia patient with affected leg falling inward/outward

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required for replacement
- **RB modifier REQUIRED** (replacement of DME item)
- **PT/OT evaluation strongly recommended** documenting:
  - Specific postural asymmetries
  - Measurements (leg alignment, pelvic position)
  - Inadequacy of standard positioning alternatives
- **Document specific asymmetry** requiring lateral support
- **Proof standard positioning inadequate**

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required (for Medicare)

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** 2 per wheelchair every 5 years *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** 2 per wheelchair (one for each side as needed) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **Included in wheelchair base at initial issue** - cannot bill separately at initial delivery
- **Separately billable ONLY as replacement** when worn or damaged
- RB modifier required for replacement billing
- **PT/OT evaluation strongly recommended** (not required but significantly improves approval likelihood)
- RESNA ATP not required
- KU modifier NOT applicable

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **PT/OT evaluation REQUIRED** (not just recommended - mandatory)
- **Fiscal order** with detailed justification
- **Comprehensive PT/OT positioning assessment** including:
  - Specific postural asymmetries documented
  - Measurements of alignment issues
  - Explanation why standard positioning inadequate
  - Positioning goals and expected outcomes

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA *(Under Review)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** 2 per wheelchair every 5 years *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** 2 per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Home assessment not required for accessory alone
- **PT/OT evaluation MANDATORY** (higher standard than Medicare)
- PA may be required depending on cost/complexity

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0953 - Lateral thigh/knee support, each"**
- [ ] **RB modifier** (replacement - REQUIRED for Medicare)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (CP, SCI, scoliosis, hemiplegia, contractures)
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation** (strongly recommended for Medicare, REQUIRED for Medicaid)
- [ ] **Document specific postural asymmetries:**
  - [ ] Windswept deformity (both legs falling to one side)
  - [ ] Hip adduction/abduction abnormality
  - [ ] Pelvic obliquity with leg asymmetry
  - [ ] Spasticity causing lateral leg instability
- [ ] **Measurements:**
  - [ ] Leg alignment relative to midline
  - [ ] Pelvic position/obliquity
  - [ ] Hip range of motion if applicable
- [ ] **Proof standard positioning inadequate:**
  - [ ] Standard wheelchair supports cannot maintain alignment
  - [ ] Asymmetry progressive without lateral support
- [ ] **Replacement justification:**
  - [ ] Current lateral support worn/damaged/broken
  - [ ] Cannot be repaired
  - [ ] Replacement necessary for proper positioning
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO with RB modifier):**
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation STRONGLY RECOMMENDED with measurements and positioning assessment
- [ ] Document specific asymmetry requiring lateral support
- [ ] Proof standard positioning inadequate
- [ ] RB modifier on claim

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation REQUIRED** (mandatory)
- [ ] Comprehensive positioning assessment
- [ ] Measurements and positioning rationale
- [ ] May need PA - check with DVS/eMedNY

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Cannot bill at initial wheelchair issue"** - E0953 billed with new wheelchair. Fix: Lateral thigh/knee supports INCLUDED in wheelchair base at initial delivery. E0953 can ONLY be billed as replacement after wheelchair delivered. Use RB modifier.

2. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** (especially Medicaid) - Missing positioning assessment. Fix: Obtain PT/OT evaluation documenting: (1) Specific postural asymmetries with measurements, (2) Inadequacy of standard positioning, (3) Need for lateral support, (4) Expected positioning outcomes. MANDATORY for Medicaid; strongly recommended for Medicare.

3. **"Standard positioning not ruled out"** - Insufficient proof standard supports inadequate. Fix: Document trials of standard positioning methods unsuccessful. PT/OT should explain why bilateral hip guides or standard leg supports cannot address asymmetry.

4. **"Measurements missing"** - No objective documentation of asymmetry. Fix: Include measurements: leg alignment angles, pelvic obliquity degree, hip range of motion limitations. Objective data supports medical necessity.

5. **"Missing RB modifier"** (Medicare) - Replacement billing without RB modifier. Fix: RB modifier REQUIRED for replacement billing.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **PT/OT evaluation strongly recommended** - significantly improves approval likelihood *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include **measurements** of postural asymmetries (angles, distances) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **inadequacy of standard positioning** alternatives *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RB modifier required for replacement
- Cannot bill at initial wheelchair issue

**NY Medicaid:**
- **PT/OT evaluation MANDATORY** (not optional) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Comprehensive positioning assessment** required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May require PA - check before ordering
- Document home and/or community positioning needs

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Postural asymmetry**: "Patient with CP and spastic diplegia; windswept deformity with both legs falling 15 degrees to right of midline; pelvic obliquity 10 degrees; bilateral hip adduction contractures"
- **Standard positioning inadequate**: "Bilateral hip guides trialed but insufficient to maintain leg alignment; legs continue falling laterally despite maximum adjustment of standard wheelchair supports"
- **PT/OT assessment**: "PT evaluation 10/25/2025: Patient requires bilateral lateral thigh supports to maintain symmetric leg positioning; measurements show 15-degree lateral deviation without supports vs. 2-degree deviation with lateral supports; prevents progression of windswept deformity"
- **Replacement justification**: "Current lateral thigh supports worn and padding compressed after 4 years of use; no longer provide adequate lateral stabilization; replacement necessary to maintain proper lower extremity alignment"

## Related Codes

- **E0953** - Lateral thigh/knee support (this code) - replacement only
- **E1032** - Lateral trunk or hip support - addresses trunk/hip positioning (different from leg positioning)
- **E0978** - Positioning belt/pelvic strap - pelvic stabilization (not leg-specific)
- **K0038** - Leg strap, each - general leg positioning strap
- **K0039** - Leg strap, H style, each - alternative leg positioning

**Note:** E0953 provides LATERAL support for thigh/knee. E1032 addresses TRUNK/HIP lateral support. Different positioning needs, different codes. E0978 is anterior pelvic stabilization, not lateral.
