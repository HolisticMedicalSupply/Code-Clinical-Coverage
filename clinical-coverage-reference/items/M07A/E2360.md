# E2360 - Group 27 Non-Sealed Lead Acid Battery / Wet Cell (NOT COVERED)

## ⚠️ COVERAGE ALERT: NOT COVERED ⚠️

**E2360 is NOT COVERED by Medicare or Medicaid.**

Same as E2358 - Non-sealed lead acid batteries (wet cell type) are **DENIED** as not reasonable and necessary per **Medicare LCD L33792**.

## Use This Code Instead (COVERED):

**For Group 27 battery size:**
- **E2359** - Group 27 **SEALED** lead acid battery (gel cell, absorbed glass mat) - **USE THIS CODE**

## Why E2360 Is NOT Covered

Same reasons as E2358:
- Non-sealed batteries (wet cell) require regular maintenance (checking/adding water)
- Risk of acid leakage and spills
- Safety hazards for users with limited mobility
- Sealed batteries provide same function without maintenance/safety issues

## What To Do

**If you need Group 27 battery for power wheelchair:**

1. **Order E2359** (Group 27 SEALED battery) instead of E2360
2. Specify battery type: gel cell or absorbed glass mat (both are sealed types)
3. Up to 2 batteries covered at any one time per LCD L33792

**Billing:**
- ❌ DO NOT bill E2360 (non-sealed wet cell) - claim will be DENIED
- ✅ Bill E2359 (sealed) - covered when medically necessary

## Related Codes

**NOT COVERED (Non-Sealed - DO NOT USE):**
- **E2358** - Group 27 non-sealed (DENIED)
- **E2360** - Group 27 non-sealed wet cell (this code - DENIED)

**COVERED (Sealed - USE THIS):**
- **E2359** - Group 27 sealed (USE THIS for Group 27 size)
