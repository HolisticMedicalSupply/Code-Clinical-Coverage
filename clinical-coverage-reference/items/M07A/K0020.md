# K0020 - Fixed Adjustable Height Armrest Pair

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Armrests - Fixed with Height Adjustment
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Fixed armrest pair for power wheelchair with adjustable height feature. Armrests remain attached to wheelchair (not detachable) but can adjust to multiple height positions. Provides height flexibility without detachable feature. Typically billed as one pair (2 armrests).

## Armrest Type Comparison

### K0020 (Fixed, Adjustable Height)
- **Detachable:** NO - fixed to wheelchair (cannot remove)
- **Height adjustable:** YES - multiple height positions
- **Use when:** Need height adjustment but NOT armrest removal
- **Billing:** Typically 1 unit = 2 armrests (pair)

### K0017 (Detachable, Adjustable Height)
- **Detachable:** YES - for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** YES - multiple height positions
- **Use when:** Need BOTH height adjustment AND armrest removal
- **Billing:** Per each armrest (2 units for pair)

### K0015 (Detachable, Non-Adjustable)
- **Detachable:** YES - for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** NO - fixed height
- **Use when:** Need armrest removal but standard height adequate
- **Billing:** Per each armrest (2 units for pair)

### Fixed Armrest (Included with Wheelchair)
- **Detachable:** NO - fixed to wheelchair
- **Height adjustable:** NO - fixed height
- **Use when:** No special armrest needs

## K0020 Selection Logic

**Choose K0020 when patient needs:**
1. ✓ Adjustable height for positioning/desk clearance
2. ✗ Does NOT need armrest removal (no side transfers)

**Do NOT choose K0020 if:**
- Patient performs side transfers needing armrest removal → Use K0017 instead
- Patient does not need height adjustment → Use basic fixed armrest instead

## Adjustable Height Applications

Height adjustment accommodates:
- **Desk clearance:** Lower armrest to slide under desk/table for work, meals, computer use
- **Variable activities:** Different heights for different activities throughout day
- **Optimal positioning:** Fine-tune armrest height for comfort and function
- **Growth accommodation:** Adjust height as child grows (pediatric wheelchairs)
- **Ergonomic positioning:** Match armrest height to patient's arm length and posture

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Medical necessity for adjustable height feature
3. Specific positioning or clearance needs requiring height adjustment
4. Patient does NOT need armrest removal (no side transfers)
5. If replacement: documentation of need

### Adjustable Height Justification

Document specific needs:
- **Desk/table use:** Patient works at desk, eats at table requiring lower armrest height
- **Multiple activities:** Different arm positions needed throughout day
- **Positioning requirements:** Specific armrest height needed for optimal arm support
- **Growth:** Pediatric patient needs adjustable height as child grows
- **Ergonomic needs:** Patient's arm length or posture requires non-standard height

### No Detachable Feature Justification

Document why fixed appropriate:
- Patient does NOT perform side transfers
- Patient uses stand-pivot transfers (armrests don't interfere)
- Patient uses mechanical lift for transfers
- Patient does not transfer independently
- Fixed armrests adequate for patient's transfer method

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue or when not included
- **KU modifier** may apply with complex rehab wheelchairs
- **RB modifier** if billing as replacement

### Units
- **Typically 1 unit = 1 pair (2 armrests)**
- Verify billing practice with specific payer
- Some payers may require billing per each armrest (2 units for pair)

### When Separately Billable

**At initial issue:**
- When NOT included in wheelchair package configuration

**As replacement:**
- Original armrests damaged or worn beyond use
- Reasonable replacement as needed
- RB modifier for replacement

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** May require PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Fixed to wheelchair:** Cannot be removed - not appropriate if transfers require armrest removal
2. **Height adjustable:** Can change height positions for various activities and positioning
3. **Typically billed as pair:** 1 unit = 2 armrests (verify with payer)
4. **Included in some packages:** Common in complex rehab wheelchairs
5. **KU modifier:** May apply with complex rehab wheelchairs
6. **Arm pads separate:** K0019 (arm pad) is separate component
7. **Face-to-face not required:** For accessory alone (if wheelchair already covered)

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Height adjustment needs:** Patient requires variable armrest heights for: [desk/table clearance for work/meals/computer use; different activities throughout day requiring different arm positions; optimal positioning for comfort and function; growth accommodation as child grows]. Patient uses [desk height/standard height] for [specific activities]. Specific armrest height requirements: [list heights needed and reasons].

**No detachable feature needed:** Patient does NOT perform side transfers requiring armrest removal. Patient's transfer method: [stand-pivot transfers/mechanical lift/does not transfer independently/assisted transfers]. Fixed armrests do not interfere with patient's transfer technique.

**Justification for K0020:** K0015 (detachable non-adjustable) inadequate because patient requires height adjustability for [positioning/desk clearance/growth]. K0017 (detachable adjustable height) unnecessary because patient does not need armrest removal for transfers. K0020 (fixed adjustable height) appropriate to accommodate height adjustment needs without unnecessary detachable feature.

[If at initial issue: Wheelchair configuration does not include fixed adjustable height armrests.] [If replacement: Original armrests damaged/worn - reasonable replacement needed.] Recommend fixed adjustable height armrests, quantity 1 pair (2 armrests - left and right)."
