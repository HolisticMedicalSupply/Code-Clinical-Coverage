# K0020 - Fixed Adjustable Height Armrest Pair

## Clinical Overview

K0020 represents a pair of fixed armrests for power wheelchairs with adjustable height feature. Armrests remain attached to wheelchair (not detachable) but can adjust to multiple height positions. Provides height flexibility without detachable feature for patients who need variable armrest heights for positioning or desk clearance but do not require armrest removal for transfers.

**Key Features:**
- Fixed to wheelchair (not detachable)
- Adjustable height - multiple height positions
- Typically billed as one pair (2 armrests)
- Used when height adjustment needed but NOT armrest removal

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Medical necessity** for adjustable height feature
- **Measurement documentation** showing need for height adjustment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Documentation** that armrest removal NOT needed (detachable not necessary) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One pair per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Included in some wheelchair packages at initial issue
- Separately billable when not included or as replacement
- Typically billed as pair: 1 unit = 2 armrests
- PT/OT not required; RESNA ATP not required
- KU modifier may apply with complex rehab wheelchairs

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** required
- **Justification** for adjustable vs. fixed height armrest
- **Patient measurements** showing need for height adjustment

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One pair per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Home assessment not required for accessory alone

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Armrest Type Comparison

### K0020 (Fixed, Adjustable Height)
- **Detachable:** NO - fixed to wheelchair (cannot remove)
- **Height adjustable:** YES - multiple height positions
- **Use when:** Need height adjustment but NOT armrest removal
- **Billing:** Typically 1 unit = 2 armrests (pair)

### K0017 (Detachable, Adjustable Height)
- **Detachable:** YES - for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** YES - multiple height positions
- **Use when:** Need BOTH height adjustment AND armrest removal
- **Billing:** Per each armrest (2 units for pair)

### K0015 (Detachable, Non-Adjustable)
- **Detachable:** YES - for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** NO - fixed height
- **Use when:** Need armrest removal but standard height adequate

## Selection Logic

**Choose K0020 when patient needs:**
1. ✓ Adjustable height for positioning/desk clearance
2. ✗ Does NOT need armrest removal (no side transfers)

**Do NOT choose K0020 if:**
- Patient performs side transfers needing armrest removal → Use K0017 instead
- Patient does not need height adjustment → Use basic fixed armrest instead

## Adjustable Height Applications

Height adjustment accommodates:
- **Desk clearance:** Lower armrest to slide under desk/table for work, meals, computer use
- **Variable activities:** Different heights for different activities throughout day
- **Optimal positioning:** Fine-tune armrest height for comfort and function
- **Growth accommodation:** Adjust height as child grows (pediatric wheelchairs)
- **Ergonomic positioning:** Match armrest height to patient's arm length and posture

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0020 - Fixed, adjustable height armrest, pair"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3, G82.x, M25.50-M25.579)
- [ ] **Medical necessity for adjustable height:**
  - [ ] Height adjustment needed for positioning or desk clearance
  - [ ] Specific positioning or clearance needs requiring height adjustment
  - [ ] Variable arm positions throughout day
- [ ] **Documentation that patient does NOT need armrest removal**
- [ ] **Patient measurements** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document medical necessity for adjustable height feature
- [ ] Measurement documentation showing need for height adjustment

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Justification for adjustable vs. fixed height armrest
- [ ] Patient measurements showing need for height adjustment

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Medical necessity not established for adjustable height"** - Vague need for adjustment. Fix: Clearly document specific need: "Patient requires variable armrest heights for desk/table clearance for work and meals. Uses desk height during work hours and standard height for other activities. Height adjustment medically necessary for functional positioning." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Detachable armrest more appropriate"** - If patient performs transfers. Fix: Document that patient does NOT perform side transfers requiring armrest removal. Example: "Patient uses stand-pivot transfers; fixed armrests do not interfere with transfer technique. Patient does not transfer independently; mechanical lift used." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Billed with new wheelchair at initial issue"** - Cannot bill separately if included. Fix: Verify whether K0020 included in wheelchair package. Bill separately only if not included in original configuration or as replacement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific functional need** for height adjustment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Describe **activities requiring different heights** (desk work, meals, etc.) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **why patient does NOT need detachable** (transfer method) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- Provide **patient measurements** showing need for non-standard height *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify adjustable vs. fixed height** with specific functional needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document activities requiring height changes
- PA may be required - check current guidelines

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Height adjustment needs:** "Patient requires variable armrest heights for: desk/table clearance for work/meals/computer use; different activities throughout day requiring different arm positions; optimal positioning for comfort and function"
- **No detachable needed:** "Patient does NOT perform side transfers requiring armrest removal. Patient's transfer method: stand-pivot transfers/mechanical lift/does not transfer independently. Fixed armrests do not interfere with transfer technique."
