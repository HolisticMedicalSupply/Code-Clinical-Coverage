# E2208 - Oxygen Cylinder Tank Carrier

## Clinical Overview

E2208 represents an oxygen cylinder tank carrier accessory for wheelchairs. This accessory provides secure mounting and storage for supplemental oxygen cylinders, allowing oxygen-dependent patients to safely transport oxygen while using their wheelchair for mobility.

**CRITICAL:** Oxygen and oxygen equipment (cylinders, concentrators, regulators, etc.) are covered separately under respiratory equipment codes (E0424, E0431, E0433, E0434, E1390, E1391, etc.). E2208 is only for the CARRIER/MOUNTING system, not the oxygen itself.

**Key Features:**
- Securely holds oxygen cylinder
- Mounted to wheelchair frame
- Accommodates various cylinder sizes (may need to specify)
- Allows patient to transport oxygen safely with wheelchair
- Prevents cylinder from falling or shifting during mobility
- Can be used with manual or power wheelchairs

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- COPD patient requiring continuous or exertional oxygen during all activities including wheelchair mobility
- Pulmonary fibrosis patient using wheelchair for energy conservation who requires oxygen during mobility
- CHF patient with oxygen dependence using wheelchair for cardiac workload reduction
- Respiratory failure patient requiring supplemental oxygen 24/7 including during wheelchair use

  - [ ] To ensure carrier can accommodate specific cylinder
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Documentation of oxygen dependence (Z99.81)

- [ ] May specify cylinder size

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Documentation of oxygen therapy prescription

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No oxygen prescription"** - Missing documentation of oxygen therapy. Fix: E2208 requires patient to have covered oxygen therapy. Document oxygen prescription: "Patient with severe COPD (FEV1 35% predicted); requires continuous oxygen therapy 2 L/min per nasal cannula 24 hours/day per pulmonologist prescription; uses manual wheelchair for all community mobility due to severe dyspnea with exertion; oxygen cylinder carrier medically necessary to transport oxygen safely with wheelchair during all mobility activities; patient cannot be mobile without oxygen."

2. **"Oxygen not covered"** - Confusion between carrier and oxygen itself. Fix: E2208 is only for the CARRIER (mounting system), not oxygen itself. Oxygen is covered separately under respiratory equipment codes. Document: "Patient has covered oxygen therapy (E0424 portable oxygen concentrator); uses power wheelchair for primary mobility; E2208 oxygen carrier requested to mount oxygen equipment to wheelchair; carrier medically necessary to securely transport oxygen with wheelchair for safe mobility."

3. **"Patient doesn't use wheelchair"** - Unclear if patient actually uses wheelchair. Fix: Document wheelchair use and why carrier needed on wheelchair: "Patient with pulmonary fibrosis; oxygen-dependent 4 L/min continuous; uses power wheelchair for all community and most household mobility due to severe dyspnea with minimal exertion; carries D-cylinder oxygen; without wheelchair carrier, patient unable to transport oxygen safely creating mobility limitation; oxygen carrier medically necessary for independent safe mobility with oxygen."

4. **"Convenience item"** - Perceived as convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: Link to safety and functional independence: "Patient with CHF and COPD; oxygen-dependent 2 L/min continuous; uses manual wheelchair for community mobility; patient lives alone; without secure oxygen carrier on wheelchair, patient attempts to hold oxygen cylinder on lap creating unsafe wheelchair propulsion (cannot use both hands) and fall risk; oxygen carrier medically necessary for safe two-handed wheelchair propulsion while maintaining required oxygen therapy."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Z99.81 diagnosis (oxygen dependence) required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document oxygen prescription** (flow rate, frequency) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Link carrier to wheelchair mobility** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Safety justification helpful** (secure transport of oxygen) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Simple accessory - minimal documentation required
- NO PA for carrier (oxygen PA separate)

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Oxygen prescription documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Medical necessity for mobility with oxygen** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Generally no PA for oxygen carrier

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **COPD with continuous oxygen**: "Patient with severe COPD (GOLD Stage 4, FEV1 28% predicted); requires continuous oxygen therapy 3 L/min via nasal cannula 24 hours/day per pulmonology prescription; uses power wheelchair for all mobility due to severe dyspnea with minimal exertion (SOB walking 10 feet); carries E-cylinder oxygen; oxygen carrier medically necessary to securely mount oxygen cylinder to wheelchair for safe mobility while maintaining continuous required oxygen therapy; without carrier, patient cannot safely transport oxygen with wheelchair"

- **Pulmonary fibrosis**: "Patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; oxygen-dependent 4 L/min at rest, 6 L/min with exertion; uses manual wheelchair for community mobility for energy conservation and dyspnea management; requires oxygen during all mobility; oxygen carrier medically necessary to transport oxygen cylinder securely with wheelchair; patient uses D-cylinder; carrier prevents cylinder from shifting or falling during wheelchair propulsion ensuring safe oxygen therapy during mobility"

- **CHF and respiratory failure**: "Patient with CHF (EF 25%) and chronic respiratory failure; oxygen-dependent 2 L/min continuous via nasal cannula; uses power wheelchair as primary mobility device due to cardiac limitations and severe deconditioning; requires oxygen 24/7 including during wheelchair mobility; oxygen carrier medically necessary to mount oxygen cylinder (D-cylinder) to wheelchair for safe secure transport; patient lives alone and requires independent mobility with oxygen for ADLs and medical appointments"

- **Safety justification**: "Patient with COPD; oxygen-dependent 2 L/min continuous; uses manual wheelchair for community mobility; patient attempted wheelchair use without oxygen carrier by holding cylinder on lap; this prevented two-handed wheelchair propulsion creating unsafe propulsion pattern and multiple near-falls; oxygen carrier medically necessary to securely mount cylinder to wheelchair allowing safe two-handed propulsion while maintaining required oxygen therapy"

## Related Codes

- **E2208** - Oxygen cylinder tank carrier (this code)
- **E2207** - Crutch and cane holder - different accessory for ambulatory aids
- **E1029/E1030** - Ventilator tray - different accessory for ventilators
- **E0424-E0434** - Oxygen equipment - oxygen itself (separate coverage)
- **E1390-E1391** - Oxygen concentrators - oxygen equipment (separate coverage)
- **K0108** - Wheelchair component/accessory NOS

**Note:** E2208 is specifically for OXYGEN cylinders. For ventilators, use E1029/E1030. For crutches/canes, use E2207. For other equipment, may need K0108 NOS code.

## Oxygen Equipment vs. Carrier

**Separate Coverage - Different Codes:**

**Oxygen Equipment (Respiratory Equipment Codes):**
- E0424 - Stationary oxygen concentrator
- E0431 - Portable gaseous oxygen system
- E0433 - Portable liquid oxygen system
- E0434 - Portable oxygen contents, gaseous
- E1390 - Oxygen concentrator, single delivery port
- E1391 - Oxygen concentrator, dual delivery port
- (Coverage requires ABG or oximetry documentation, separate LCD)

**Oxygen Carrier (Wheelchair Accessory Code):**
- **E2208** - Wheelchair oxygen carrier (this code)
- Requires oxygen prescription but covered as wheelchair accessory
- Different LCD than oxygen equipment

**Patient needs both:**
1. Covered oxygen equipment (E0424, E0431, etc.) - for oxygen itself
2. Covered oxygen carrier (E2208) - to mount oxygen to wheelchair
