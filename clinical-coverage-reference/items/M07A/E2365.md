# E2365 - U-1 Sealed Lead Acid Battery

## Clinical Overview

E2365 represents U-1 sealed lead acid batteries for power wheelchairs. U-1 is the SMALLEST battery size in power wheelchair battery codes, used in compact/portable power wheelchairs with space constraints. Same coverage requirements as E2359 (Group 27 sealed) - only difference is battery size.

**CRITICAL:** **ONLY SEALED batteries covered.** No non-sealed U-1 code exists (all non-sealed batteries DENIED per LCD L33792).

**Key Features:**
- U-1 battery size (smallest size for power wheelchairs)
- Physical dimensions: approx. 7.8" L x 5.2" W x 7.2" H
- Typical capacity: 30-35 Ah
- SEALED lead acid type: gel cell OR absorbed glass mat (AGM)
- Maintenance-free
- Typically used in smaller/portable power wheelchairs
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time per LCD L33792

## Coverage Details

**Same coverage as E2359 (Group 27 sealed) - all requirements identical except battery size.**

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (sealed batteries only)

**All requirements same as E2359:**
- SWO required
- NO PA
- NO face-to-face required for battery replacement
- Documentation power wheelchair meets coverage criteria
- Proof outside warranty
- Battery specifications (U-1 sealed)
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time per LCD L33792

### NY Medicaid

**Covered:** Yes (sealed batteries only)

**All requirements same as E2359:**
- Fiscal order
- Documentation wheelchair meets WME criteria
- Proof outside warranty
- May require PA depending on frequency
- Delivery within 30 days
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time

## Prescription Checklist

**Same as E2359 except:**
- [ ] Specify battery size: **U-1** (smallest size)
- [ ] Verify wheelchair uses U-1 size (check wheelchair manual/specification)
- [ ] Typical for compact/portable power wheelchairs

**All other requirements identical to E2359.**

## Common Denial Reasons

**Same as E2359 plus:**

**"Wrong battery size"** - Must match wheelchair specification. Fix: "Patient's compact power wheelchair (K0813) requires U-1 batteries per manufacturer specification; ordering 2 units E2365 (U-1 sealed, gel cell type) matching wheelchair battery compartment size for compact wheelchair."

## Tips for Approval

**Same as E2359 - all tips identical.**

Key points:
- Document wheelchair outside warranty
- ONLY sealed batteries (gel cell or absorbed glass mat)
- Up to 2 batteries maximum
- Battery wear/diminished capacity documented
- **Verify correct battery size** (U-1 for this code - smallest size)
- U-1 typically used in compact/portable power wheelchairs

## Related Codes

**COVERED - Sealed Batteries:**
- **E2359** - Group 27 sealed (standard size)
- **E2361** - Group 24 sealed
- **E2363** - Group 22NF sealed
- **E2365** - U-1 sealed (this code - smallest size)
- **E2371** - Group 24 sealed deep cycle
- **K0733** - Group 34 sealed (largest size)

**Charger:**
- **E2366** - Single mode battery charger (for sealed batteries)

## Battery Size Comparison

**U-1** (E2365) - This code:
- **Smallest size** for power wheelchairs
- Physical dimensions: approx. 7.8" L x 5.2" W x 7.2" H
- Typical capacity: 30-35 Ah
- Used in compact/portable power wheelchairs with space constraints
- Lower capacity than Group 22NF, Group 24, or Group 27

**Size Progression (Smallest to Largest):**
1. **U-1** (E2365) - 7.8" L - smallest
2. Group 22NF (E2363) - 9.5" L
3. Group 24 (E2361) - 10.2" L
4. Group 27 (E2359) - 12.0" L - standard size
5. Group 34 (K0733) - largest

**Check wheelchair specification** to determine if U-1 required. U-1 typically only used in compact wheelchairs where larger batteries won't fit.
