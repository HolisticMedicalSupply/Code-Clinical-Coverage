# K0019 - Wheelchair Arm Pad

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Armrest Accessories
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Cushioning pad that attaches to wheelchair armrest to provide comfort and support for forearms. Replaceable wearing component. Small accessory included with armrests at initial issue, billed separately as replacement when worn.

## Arm Pad vs. Armrest Structure

### K0019 (Arm Pad)
- **Component:** Cushioning pad (comfort layer)
- **Function:** Provides cushioning for forearms
- **Material:** Foam/gel cushioning with vinyl/fabric cover
- **Size:** Small pad covering top armrest surface
- **Durability:** Wearing part - wears faster than armrest structure
- **Replacement:** Separately billable as replacement

### Armrest Structure (K0015, K0017, K0020)
- **Component:** Structural armrest frame
- **Function:** Provides arm support structure
- **Material:** Metal/plastic structural components
- **Size:** Full armrest assembly
- **Durability:** Durable structure
- **Replacement:** Arm pad (K0019) attaches to armrest

## Arm Pad Function and Wear

### Function
Arm pad provides:
- Cushioning for forearms during wheelchair use
- Comfort for extended sitting
- Protection from hard armrest surface
- Grip surface for arm positioning

### Common Wear Patterns

**Material wear:**
- Torn or ripped cover material from friction
- Cracked or degraded vinyl/fabric surface
- Seams separated from stress

**Cushioning degradation:**
- Foam compressed/flattened (lost cushioning)
- Cushioning material deteriorated
- Insufficient padding remaining

**Contamination:**
- Bodily fluids absorbed (cannot be cleaned)
- Food/beverage stains
- Contamination creating infection risk

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient uses power wheelchair with armrests
2. Arm pad worn or damaged requiring replacement
3. Arm pad not under manufacturer warranty
4. Description of wear/damage
5. For replacement (pads included at initial issue)

### Examples of Arm Pad Wear/Damage

**Normal wear:**
- Material torn from repeated use
- Cushioning compressed/flattened
- Cover cracked or deteriorated
- Seams separated

**Damage:**
- Torn from sharp object
- Contaminated beyond cleaning
- Material degraded from exposure

**Usage-related:**
- Extended wheelchair use (full-time users) causes faster wear
- Frequent armrest contact accelerates wear
- Bodily fluids cause contamination

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each arm pad
- Typically order 2 pads (one for left armrest, one for right armrest)
- Quantity based on number of armrests needing pad replacement

### Typical Order
- Quantity 2 (both armrests) - Most common
- Quantity 1 (single armrest) - If only one pad worn

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA for minor accessories

## Special Considerations

1. **Minor accessory:** Small, inexpensive replacement part
2. **Replacement only:** Included with armrests at initial issue
3. **RB modifier required:** Indicates replacement of part of DME
4. **Typically order pair:** Both pads (2 units) for symmetry and consistency
5. **Faster wear with extended use:** Full-time wheelchair users need more frequent replacement
6. **Attaches to armrest:** Must have armrests (K0015, K0017, K0020) installed
7. **Simple documentation:** Brief description of wear adequate
8. **No face-to-face required:** Minor replacement part
9. **Warranty verification:** Confirm pads not under manufacturer warranty

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair [full-time/part-time] with [detachable/adjustable height/fixed] armrests.
