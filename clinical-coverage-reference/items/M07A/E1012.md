# E1012 - Power Elevating Leg Rest (Center Mount, for Power Seating Systems)

## Clinical Overview

E1012 represents a center-mount power elevating leg rest system that is an addition to power seating systems (power tilt/recline). This provides powered leg elevation that coordinates with power seating position changes. Requires highest level of documentation: PT/OT specialty evaluation, RESNA ATP, and prior authorization.

**PREREQUISITE:** Patient must have covered power seating system (E1002-E1008). Power elevating legrests are an addition to power seating, not standalone.

**Key Features:**
- Powered leg elevation (not manual)
- Coordinates with power tilt/recline systems
- Center mount design
- Bundled with multiple components (E0990, E0995, E1009, footrest parts)
- Billed per each (typically need pair)

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- High SCI patient with power tilt/recline requiring coordinated powered leg elevation
- ALS patient with power seating needing powered leg elevation
- Patient with pressure ulcers using power tilt/recline with powered elevation for positioning

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis codes (power seating indications + elevating legrest indications)
- [ ] **PREREQUISITE - Covered power seating system:**
  - [ ] Patient has E1002-E1008 (power tilt, power recline, or combination)
  - [ ] Power seating system medically necessary
- [ ] **Meets elevating legrest coverage criteria** (same as E0990):
  - [ ] Musculoskeletal/cast/brace preventing 90-degree flexion, OR
  - [ ] Significant edema requiring elevation, OR
  - [ ] Reclining back on wheelchair
- [ ] **Medical necessity for POWERED elevation:**
  - [ ] Why manual elevation (E0990) inadequate
  - [ ] Need for coordination with power tilt/recline
  - [ ] Upper extremity limitations preventing manual operation
  - [ ] Safety/positioning benefits of powered coordination
- [ ] **PT/OT SPECIALTY EVALUATION** (REQUIRED):
  - [ ] Evaluation by PT/OT with complex rehab expertise
  - [ ] Documentation of power seating need
  - [ ] Documentation of powered leg elevation need
  - [ ] Coordination with seating system explained
  - [ ] No financial relationship with supplier (Medicaid)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No power seating system"** - Patient doesn't have covered power tilt/recline. Fix: E1012 requires covered power seating system (E1002-E1008) FIRST. If patient doesn't have power seating, cannot bill E1012. Order appropriate power seating system first, then power elevating legrests as addition.

2. **"Manual elevation adequate"** - Insufficient justification for powered vs. manual. Fix: Must document why manual elevating legrests (E0990) inadequate: "Patient has high C6 SCI with no hand function; cannot manually operate elevating legrests; power tilt/recline system for pressure relief requires coordinated powered leg elevation for proper positioning; manual elevation unsafe and impractical given upper extremity limitations."

3. **"Missing PT/OT specialty evaluation"** - Regular PT/OT eval not sufficient. Fix: Requires PT/OT SPECIALTY evaluation by therapist with complex rehab wheelchair expertise. Regular PT/OT not sufficient for complex rehab items like E1012.

4. **"Missing RESNA ATP"** - No RESNA ATP documentation. Fix: RESNA ATP REQUIRED for E1012. Must have evaluation/documentation from RESNA-certified Assistive Technology Professional.

5. **"Bundled codes billed separately"** - E0990, E0995, E1009 billed with E1012. Fix: E1012 BUNDLES E0990 (manual legrest), E0995 (calf pads), E1009 (actuator), and footrest components. Cannot bill these separately when billing E1012.

6. **"Missing PA"** (if initial power seating order). Fix: If E1012 part of initial power seating system order, PA REQUIRED. Submit PA before ordering.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **PA required** if part of initial power seating order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT SPECIALTY evaluation REQUIRED** - regular PT/OT insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **RESNA ATP REQUIRED** - mandatory documentation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **powered vs. manual necessity** clearly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **KU modifier REQUIRED** on claim *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **coordination with power seating system**

**NY Medicaid:**
- **PA and DVS authorization both REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT specialty evaluation with no supplier financial relationship** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **RESNA ATP documentation REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Home assessment REQUIRED**
- Comprehensive WME guidelines documentation

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Power seating prerequisite**: "Patient has covered power tilt system (E1002) for pressure relief (recurrent stage 3 sacral ulcer); power tilt to 35 degrees for pressure redistribution; powered leg elevation required to coordinate with tilt positioning"
- **Powered vs manual necessity**: "Patient with C5 complete SCI; no hand function; cannot manually operate elevating legrests; power tilt/recline system requires coordinated powered leg elevation for proper positioning and safety; manual operation impossible given upper extremity limitations; powered elevation coordinates with power tilt for optimal pressure relief positioning"
- **PT/OT specialty evaluation**: "PT specialty evaluation 10/25/2025 by PT with RESNA ATP certification and 15 years complex rehab experience; patient requires powered leg elevation coordinated with power tilt system; manual elevation inadequate due to upper extremity limitations; powered elevation optimizes pressure relief positioning with power seating system"
