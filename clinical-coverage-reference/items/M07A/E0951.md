# E0951 - Heel Loop/Holder (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E0951 represents a heel loop or holder (with or without ankle strap) used to maintain proper foot positioning on wheelchair footrests. This accessory prevents heel migration off the footrest due to spasticity, contractures, or foot deformities, maintaining proper lower extremity alignment and safety.

**CRITICAL**: This is a **REPLACEMENT-ONLY** code. Heel loops are included in the wheelchair base at initial delivery and can only be billed separately as replacements.

**Key Features:**
- Prevents heel slippage off footrest
- Maintains lower extremity alignment
- Safety device for foot positioning
- Used with manual or power wheelchairs
- May include ankle strap component

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Cerebral palsy patient with spastic lower extremities requiring heel stabilization
- SCI patient with foot drop and heel slippage concerns
- Stroke patient with hemiplegia and poor foot positioning
- MS patient with spasticity causing heel migration

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required for replacement
- **RB modifier REQUIRED** (replacement of DME item)
- **Document positioning need** and safety concerns
- **Proof heel loop is worn/damaged** and requires replacement

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for replacement accessory *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** 2 in 5 years per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** 2 per wheelchair (one for each foot) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **Included in wheelchair base at initial issue** - cannot bill separately at initial delivery
- **Separately billable ONLY as replacement** when worn or damaged
- RB modifier required for replacement billing
- PT/OT not required; RESNA ATP not required
- KU modifier NOT applicable

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** specifying heel loop replacement
- **Justification for replacement** (worn, damaged, broken)
- **Home and/or community use**

**Prior Authorization:** Generally no PA for minor accessories *(Under Review)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for replacement *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** 2 in 5 years *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** 2 per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Home assessment not required for replacement accessory
- Replacement covered when medically necessary

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0951 - Heel loop/holder, any type, each"**
- [ ] **RB modifier** (replacement - REQUIRED for Medicare)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (CP, SCI, stroke, MS, contractures)
- [ ] **Document need for heel positioning:**
  - [ ] Spasticity causing heel migration
  - [ ] Contractures preventing proper foot positioning
  - [ ] Safety concern with heel slippage off footrest
  - [ ] Maintains lower extremity alignment
- [ ] **Replacement justification:**
  - [ ] Current heel loop worn/damaged/broken
  - [ ] Cannot be repaired
  - [ ] Replacement medically necessary for safe wheelchair use
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO with RB modifier):**
- [ ] Document positioning need and safety concerns
- [ ] Proof heel loop worn or damaged
- [ ] RB modifier on claim

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify "heel loop replacement"
- [ ] Justification for replacement (condition of current heel loop)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Cannot bill at initial wheelchair issue"** - E0951 billed with new wheelchair. Fix: Heel loops INCLUDED in wheelchair base at initial delivery. E0951 can ONLY be billed as replacement after wheelchair delivered. Use RB modifier.

2. **"Missing RB modifier"** (Medicare) - Replacement billing without RB modifier. Fix: RB modifier REQUIRED for replacement billing. Add RB modifier to claim to indicate replacement of existing DME item.

3. **"Medical necessity not documented"** - Insufficient justification for replacement. Fix: Document: (1) Patient has spasticity/contractures requiring heel positioning, (2) Current heel loop worn/damaged/broken, (3) Cannot be repaired, (4) Replacement necessary for safe wheelchair use.

4. **"Frequency exceeded"** - Requesting replacement <5 years from last replacement. Fix: Medicare/Medicaid allow 2 heel loops per wheelchair in 5 years. If requesting earlier replacement, provide detailed justification (excessive wear, patient factors, wheelchair use patterns).

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **RB modifier MANDATORY** for replacement billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Cannot bill at initial wheelchair issue - **included in base** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **specific positioning need** (spasticity, contractures, safety) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide **evidence of wear/damage** requiring replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Clearly state "**replacement**" in fiscal order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify replacement (worn, damaged, broken)
- Generally no PA needed for minor accessory replacement
- Document positioning need related to diagnosis

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Positioning need**: "Patient with CP and spastic diplegia; heel loops prevent heel migration off footrests due to extensor spasticity; maintain proper lower extremity alignment and prevent foot entrapment"
- **Replacement justification**: "Current heel loops worn and torn after 3 years of use; straps frayed and no longer secure heel position; replacement necessary for continued safe wheelchair use"
- **Safety concern**: "Without functional heel loops, patient's heels slip off footrests creating fall risk and improper positioning"

## Related Codes

- **E0951** - Heel loop/holder (this code) - replacement only
- **E0952** - Toe loop/holder - similar positioning accessory for toes
- **K0038** - Leg strap, each - additional positioning strap
- **K0039** - Leg strap, H style, each - alternative leg positioning
- **K0042** - Standard size footplate, replacement - footrest component

**Note:** E0951 and E0952 are both replacement-only codes included in wheelchair base at initial issue. Other footrest components (footplates, extension tubes, hangers) have separate K-codes for replacement.
