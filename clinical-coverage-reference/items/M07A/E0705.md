# E0705 - Transfer Device (Transfer Board)

## Clinical Overview

E0705 represents a transfer device, most commonly a transfer board (also called slide board), used to facilitate safe transfers for patients with paralysis or significant bilateral lower extremity weakness. The device provides a smooth surface for slide transfers between wheelchair and other surfaces (bed, car seat, commode, etc.) when the patient cannot perform independent standing or pivot transfers.

**Key Features:**
- Transfer board for slide transfers
- Used with caregiver assistance
- Facilitates safe wheelchair transfers to bed, car, commode
- For patients unable to perform independent transfers

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Spinal cord injury patients requiring slide board transfers
- Stroke patients with severe hemiplegia or bilateral weakness
- Cerebral palsy patients with limited lower extremity function
- Muscular dystrophy patients requiring transfer assistance

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required before claim submission
- **Medical records** documenting inability to safely transfer independently
- **Transfer assessment** showing need for transfer device
- **Caregiver training** in safe transfer techniques *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Not specifically required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement when damaged *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One per patient as medically necessary *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **Purchase only** (cannot rent)
- **NOT separately billable** with new wheelchair at initial issue
- **Separately billable only** as replacement or addition after wheelchair delivered
- PT/OT evaluation not required but recommended
- RESNA ATP not required
- KU modifier NOT applicable

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** required
- **Documentation of transfer limitations** and need for device
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** (not required)
- **Home assessment NOT required** for transfer device alone

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA depending on cost *(Under Review)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One per patient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Home and/or community use
- Not separately billable at wheelchair initial issue
- PT/OT evaluation recommended for proper device selection and caregiver training

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0705 - Transfer device, any type, each"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (paralysis, weakness, SCI, stroke, CP, MD)
- [ ] **Document inability to perform independent transfers:**
  - [ ] Cannot stand for pivot transfers
  - [ ] Bilateral lower extremity weakness/paralysis
  - [ ] Requires caregiver assistance for all transfers
- [ ] **Transfer assessment:**
  - [ ] Current transfer method unsafe or impossible
  - [ ] Slide board transfers appropriate for patient's level of function
  - [ ] Caregiver capable of assisting with slide board transfers
- [ ] **Medical necessity justification**
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document specific transfer limitations
- [ ] Explain why independent transfers not possible
- [ ] Note caregiver availability and training

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended (device selection, sizing, caregiver training)
- [ ] Document home and/or community use needs
- [ ] Describe transfer situations requiring device (bed, car, commode, etc.)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient capable of independent transfers"** - Transfer assessment inadequate. Fix: Document specific assessment showing patient cannot perform safe independent transfers due to paralysis/weakness. Include functional assessment of lower extremity strength, standing balance, and current unsafe transfer methods.

2. **"Billed with new wheelchair at initial issue"** - Cannot bill separately at initial wheelchair delivery. Fix: Transfer device included with wheelchair at initial issue. Can only bill E0705 separately as replacement or addition after wheelchair delivery. Medicare bundling policy.

3. **"Medical necessity not documented"** - Insufficient justification. Fix: Clearly document: (1) Diagnosis causing transfer limitation, (2) Current transfer method unsafe, (3) Need for slide board specifically, (4) Caregiver availability and capability for assisted transfers.

4. **"No written order on file"** (Medicare) - SWO missing. Fix: Submit Standard Written Order before claim. Include specific HCPCS code E0705, diagnosis, medical necessity, and physician signature.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific functional assessment** of transfer ability *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **why independent transfers not possible** (paralysis, bilateral weakness) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Note **caregiver availability** for assisted transfers *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO must be on file before billing
- Cannot bill separately at wheelchair initial issue (bundled)

**NY Medicaid:**
- **PT/OT evaluation strongly recommended** for device selection and caregiver training *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document both **home AND community** transfer needs if applicable *(Under Review)*
- Describe specific transfer situations (bed, car, commode, etc.)
- May need PA if high cost - check with DVS/eMedNY

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Functional assessment**: "Patient with T6 complete SCI, no lower extremity motor function, unable to stand for pivot transfers, requires slide board for all bed/wheelchair/car transfers with caregiver assistance"
- **Safety concerns**: "Current transfer method (two-person lift) unsafe and unsustainable; slide board reduces caregiver strain and patient fall risk"
- **Caregiver training**: "Spouse trained in slide board transfer technique by PT; demonstrates safe transfer ability"

## Related Codes

- **E0705** - Transfer device (this code) - for wheelchair transfers
- **E0621** - Patient lift, sling or seat type (non-covered by Medicare for transfer between wheelchair and bed per LCD - considered convenience)
- **E0630** - Patient lift, hydraulic or mechanical (hospital bed to wheelchair transfers)

**Note:** E0705 transfer board is distinct from mechanical patient lifts. Transfer board requires patient to have some sitting balance and trunk control; patient lifts used when patient has no ability to assist with transfers.
