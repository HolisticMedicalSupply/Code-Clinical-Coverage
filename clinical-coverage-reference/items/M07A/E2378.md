# E2378 - Actuator (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E2378 represents replacement actuators for power wheelchair seating systems. Actuators are motorized linear actuators powering seat positioning functions (tilt, recline, leg elevation). For REPLACEMENT only when actuator fails. Each power seating function typically has dedicated actuator.

**CRITICAL:** K0108 (wheelchair component NOS) should NOT be used for actuators. Use E2378 specific code.

**Key Features:**
- Powers seat positioning functions
- Functions: power tilt, power recline, power leg elevation
- Replacement only (included with power seating at initial issue)
- Must specify which function affected
- RB modifier required
- Must be outside warranty period

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** specifying actuator replacement
- **Documentation of actuator failure**
- **Which function affected** (tilt, recline, leg elevation)
- **Proof NOT covered under warranty**

**Prior Authorization:** NO PA
**Face-to-Face:** Not required *(Under Review)*
**PT/OT/RESNA ATP:** Not required
**Modifiers:** **RB modifier REQUIRED** for replacement
**Frequency:** Replacement when failed and not under warranty *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
**Quantity:** As needed per power seating functions *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- For REPLACEMENT only
- Included with power seating at initial issue
- Used with power seating systems (E1002-E1008, E1012)
- KU modifier may apply with complex rehab *(Under Review)*
- **DO NOT use K0108** - use E2378 specifically

### NY Medicaid

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** specifying actuator replacement and function
- **Documentation of failure**
- **Warranty status**

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA *(Under Review)*
**Face-to-Face:** Not required *(Under Review)*
**Frequency:** Replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
**Quantity:** As needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E2378 - Actuator, replacement only"**
- [ ] **Modifier: RB (replacement part)**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 wheelchair dependence)
- [ ] **Actuator failure documentation:**
  - [ ] **Which function affected:** power tilt, power recline, or power leg elevation
  - [ ] Actuator malfunction description
  - [ ] How failure affects positioning function
  - [ ] Why positioning function medically necessary
- [ ] **Power seating system documentation:**
  - [ ] Which power seating system patient has (E1002-E1008, E1012)
  - [ ] Medical necessity for power seating function
- [ ] **Warranty status:** Wheelchair age, proof outside warranty
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Written order specifying actuator replacement
- [ ] Documentation of actuator failure
- [ ] Which function affected (tilt, recline, leg elevation)
- [ ] Proof not covered under warranty
- [ ] RB modifier
- [ ] **Use E2378, NOT K0108**

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Fiscal order specifying actuator and function
- [ ] Documentation of failure
- [ ] Warranty status
- [ ] May need PA - check first

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Under warranty"** - Fix: "Wheelchair with power tilt purchased 3 years ago; warranty expired; tilt actuator failed outside warranty; E2378 replacement not covered under warranty."

2. **"Actuator failure not documented"** - Fix: "Power tilt actuator stopped functioning; tilt function inoperable; patient cannot tilt for pressure relief; actuator motor makes noise but does not extend/retract; power tilt system medically necessary for pressure ulcer prevention; actuator replacement medically necessary to restore pressure relief function."

3. **"No RB modifier"** - Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier for replacement parts.

4. **"Function not specified"** - Fix: Must specify which function: "Power TILT actuator replacement needed; tilt actuator failed; recline and leg elevation actuators functioning normally; only tilt actuator requires replacement."

5. **"K0108 used instead of E2378"** - Fix: DO NOT use K0108 for actuators. Use E2378: "E2378 is specific code for actuator replacement; K0108 (NOS code) should not be used for actuators per LCD guidance."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document actuator failure** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **SPECIFY which function** (tilt, recline, leg elevation) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Proof outside warranty** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **RB modifier REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Use E2378, NOT K0108** - critical distinction
- Link to medical necessity of power seating function

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Documentation of failure and function** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Warranty status** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **May require PA** - check first

## Clinical Documentation Best Practices

**Power tilt actuator:** "Patient with C6 SCI has power tilt system (E1002) for pressure relief; requires tilt to 35 degrees every 30 minutes per pressure relief protocol; power tilt actuator failed - actuator motor runs but does not extend, wheelchair will not tilt; patient unable to perform pressure relief tilts creating pressure ulcer risk; power tilt medically necessary for pressure management; wheelchair 4 years old, outside warranty; tilt actuator replacement (E2378) medically necessary to restore pressure relief function"

**Power recline actuator:** "Patient with MS has power recline system (E1003) for orthostatic hypotension management and positioning; power recline actuator failed - wheelchair will not recline, stuck in upright position; patient requires recline to 60 degrees for BP management when symptomatic; unable to recline for hypotension episodes; power recline medically necessary; wheelchair 3 years old, outside warranty; recline actuator replacement (E2378) medically necessary to restore positioning and BP management function"

**Power leg elevation actuator:** "Patient with power elevating legrests (E1012) for edema management; power leg elevation actuator failed - legrests will not elevate; patient has significant bilateral leg edema requiring elevation; unable to elevate legs for edema control; power leg elevation medically necessary per vascular specialist; wheelchair 5 years old, outside warranty; leg elevation actuator replacement (E2378) medically necessary to restore edema management function"
