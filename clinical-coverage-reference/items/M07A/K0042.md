# K0042 - Standard Size Footplate (Replacement Only)

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Footplates - Replacement
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Standard size footplate replacement for power wheelchair. For replacing damaged, broken, or worn standard footplates that are outside manufacturer warranty. Standard size (not large), non-adjustable angle. RA modifier required. FOR REPLACEMENT ONLY - not billable at initial wheelchair issue.

## CRITICAL: Replacement Only

**K0042 is for REPLACEMENT ONLY:**
- Standard footplates INCLUDED with wheelchair at initial issue
- K0042 CANNOT be billed at initial wheelchair delivery
- Only billable as replacement when original footplate damaged/worn
- Must be outside manufacturer warranty
- RA modifier required to indicate replacement

## Footplate Types

### K0042 (Standard Size, Replacement)
- **Size:** Standard (not large - see K0041 for large)
- **Angle:** Fixed (not adjustable - see K0040 for adjustable)
- **Use:** Replacement of standard footplate only
- **Modifier:** RA required

### K0040 (Adjustable Angle)
- Use for replacement if original was adjustable angle footplate

### K0041 (Large Size)
- Use for replacement if original was large size footplate
- Or if patient now needs large size (document why)

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document for Replacement
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Standard footplate damaged, broken, or worn
3. Specific damage description
4. Damage cannot be repaired
5. Damage affects safety or function (not just cosmetic)
6. Footplate outside manufacturer warranty
7. If early replacement: beyond reasonable useful lifetime

### Damage Documentation

Document specific damage:

**Structural damage:**
- Cracked or fractured footplate (could break during use)
- Bent footplate (affects proper foot positioning)
- Broken mounting points (footplate doesn't secure properly)
- Material failure (plastic degraded, metal corroded)

**Functional damage:**
- Worn surface with rough edges (skin irritation risk)
- Deformed shape preventing proper foot support
- Mounting damage causing instability
- Surface deterioration affecting safety

**Why cannot repair:**
- Structural damage too severe for safe repair
- Repair would compromise safety/integrity
- Repair materials not available
- Repair cost exceeds replacement cost

**How affects safety/function:**
- Creates fall/injury risk if footplate breaks
- Improper foot positioning from bent/deformed footplate
- Skin irritation/injury from rough/deteriorated surface
- Instability from damaged mounting

### Warranty Documentation

**CRITICAL:** Must document outside warranty
- Most wheelchairs have 1-year parts warranty
- Verify warranty end date
- If within warranty, patient must pursue warranty claim with manufacturer
- If outside warranty, document warranty expiration date

### Useful Lifetime Justification

If replacing before expected 3-5 year lifespan:
- Heavy wheelchair use pattern (full-time outdoor use)
- Unusual damage circumstances (accident, impact)
- Accelerated wear factors (rough terrain, extreme conditions)
- Document why early replacement necessary

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RA** (required) - Replacement of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each footplate
- Order quantity based on need:
  - 1 footplate (single footplate damaged)
  - 2 footplates (both footplates damaged or replacing as pair)

### RA vs. RB Modifier

**RA modifier (K0042):**
- Replacement of complete DME ITEM
- Footplate is complete item being replaced
- Use RA for K0042

**RB modifier (other codes):**
- Replacement of PART of DME item
- For components that are parts of larger items
- Not used for K0042

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Check current codes; not required per policy notes

## Special Considerations

1. **Replacement only:** Cannot bill at initial wheelchair issue - included in base wheelchair
2. **RA modifier required:** Indicates replacement of complete DME item
3. **Warranty critical:** Must be outside manufacturer warranty
4. **Cannot repair:** Must document repair not possible/appropriate
5. **Affects safety/function:** Cosmetic damage alone insufficient
6. **Standard size/angle only:** Use K0040 or K0041 if adjustable/large size needed
7. **Useful lifetime:** Typically 3-5 years; justify if replacing sooner
8. **Face-to-face not required:** For replacement accessory

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Footplate damage:** [Left/Right/Both] standard footplate [damaged/broken/worn] requiring replacement. Specific damage: [cracked footplate with structural failure risk/bent footplate affecting foot positioning/worn surface with rough edges causing skin irritation risk/broken mounting points causing instability/material deterioration compromising integrity].

**Cannot be repaired:** Footplate cannot be repaired because [structural damage too severe for safe repair/repair would compromise footplate safety and integrity/repair materials not available/repair cost exceeds replacement cost]. Replacement necessary.

**Safety/function impact:** Damaged footplate affects [safety/function] by [creating fall risk if footplate breaks during use/causing improper foot positioning from bent/deformed shape/causing skin irritation from rough/deteriorated surface/creating instability from damaged mounting]. Footplate replacement necessary for safe wheelchair use.

**Warranty status:** Footplate outside manufacturer warranty. Wheelchair purchased [date]. Manufacturer warranty expired [date]. [Verify warranty documentation if available.]

**Useful lifetime:** [If standard 3-5 year replacement:] Footplate at end of reasonable useful lifetime [age of wheelchair]. [If early replacement:] Early replacement necessary due to [heavy use pattern/accident damage/unusual wear circumstances - describe].

**Footplate type needed:** Standard size, non-adjustable angle footplate (K0042) appropriate - matches original footplate type. [If changing type:] Patient now requires [large size K0041 / adjustable angle K0040] due to [new clinical need - document].

Recommend standard size footplate replacement (K0042), quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both], RA modifier for replacement."
