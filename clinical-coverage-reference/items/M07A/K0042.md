# K0042 - Standard Size Footplate (Replacement Only)

## Clinical Overview

K0042 represents a standard size footplate replacement for power wheelchairs. For replacing damaged, broken, or worn standard footplates that are outside manufacturer warranty. Standard size (not large), non-adjustable angle. RA modifier required. FOR REPLACEMENT ONLY - not billable at initial wheelchair issue.

**Key Features:**
- FOR REPLACEMENT ONLY (not at initial issue)
- Standard size (not large - see K0041 for large)
- Non-adjustable angle (see K0040 for adjustable)
- RA modifier required
- Must be outside warranty

## CRITICAL: Replacement Only

**K0042 is for REPLACEMENT ONLY:**
- Standard footplates INCLUDED with wheelchair at initial issue
- K0042 CANNOT be billed at initial wheelchair delivery
- Only billable as replacement when original footplate damaged/worn
- Must be outside manufacturer warranty
- RA modifier required to indicate replacement

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Footplate Types

### K0042 (Standard Size, Replacement)
- **Size:** Standard (not large - see K0041 for large)
- **Angle:** Fixed (not adjustable - see K0040 for adjustable)
- **Use:** Replacement of standard footplate only
- **Modifier:** RA required

### K0040 (Adjustable Angle)
- Use for replacement if original was adjustable angle footplate

### K0041 (Large Size)
- Use for replacement if original was large size footplate
- Or if patient now needs large size (document why)

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document for Replacement

1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Standard footplate damaged, broken, or worn
3. Specific damage description
4. Damage cannot be repaired
5. Damage affects safety or function (not just cosmetic)
6. Footplate outside manufacturer warranty
7. If early replacement: beyond reasonable useful lifetime

### Damage Documentation

Document specific damage:

**Structural damage:**
- Cracked or fractured footplate (could break during use)
- Bent footplate (affects proper foot positioning)
- Broken mounting points (footplate doesn't secure properly)
- Material failure (plastic degraded, metal corroded)

**Functional damage:**
- Worn surface with rough edges (skin irritation risk)
- Deformed shape preventing proper foot support
- Mounting damage causing instability
- Surface deterioration affecting safety

**Why cannot repair:**
- Structural damage too severe for safe repair
- Repair would compromise safety/integrity
- Repair materials not available
- Repair cost exceeds replacement cost

**How affects safety/function:**
- Creates fall/injury risk if footplate breaks
- Improper foot positioning from bent/deformed footplate
- Skin irritation/injury from rough/deteriorated surface
- Instability from damaged mounting

### Warranty Documentation

**CRITICAL:** Must document outside warranty

- Most wheelchairs have 1-year parts warranty
- Verify warranty end date
- If within warranty, patient must pursue warranty claim with manufacturer
- If outside warranty, document warranty expiration date

### Useful Lifetime Justification

If replacing before expected 3-5 year lifespan:
- Heavy wheelchair use pattern (full-time outdoor use)
- Unusual damage circumstances (accident, impact)
- Accelerated wear factors (rough terrain, extreme conditions)
- Document why early replacement necessary

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0042 - Standard size footplate, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3, Z74.09)
- [ ] **For REPLACEMENT ONLY** (not at initial issue)
- [ ] **Damage documentation:**
  - [ ] Specific damage description (cracked, bent, worn, etc.)
  - [ ] Cannot be repaired - explain why
  - [ ] Affects safety or function - explain how
- [ ] **Warranty status:**
  - [ ] Outside manufacturer warranty
  - [ ] Warranty expiration date
- [ ] **If early replacement:** justification why beyond reasonable useful lifetime
- [ ] **RA modifier** - replacement of DME item
- [ ] **Quantity:** 1 or 2 footplates based on need
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document damage, cannot repair, affects safety/function
- [ ] Document outside warranty
- [ ] RA modifier required

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Damage description
- [ ] Warranty status
- [ ] Check current codes availability

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Footplate still under warranty"** - Manufacturer warranty not expired. Fix: Verify warranty expiration date. Document: "Wheelchair purchased [date]. Manufacturer warranty expired [date]. Footplate now outside warranty - replacement covered by [Medicare/Medicaid]. Warranty documentation attached." If still under warranty, pursue warranty claim with manufacturer first. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Damage not documented"** - Vague description. Fix: Provide specific damage details: "Standard footplate cracked with structural failure at [location]. Crack extends [X] inches creating risk of complete breakage during wheelchair use. Affects safety - footplate could fail causing patient fall or foot injury. Cannot be repaired - structural damage too severe for safe repair." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Cosmetic damage only - not medical necessity"** - Damage doesn't affect safety/function. Fix: Document how damage affects safety or function: "Worn footplate surface has rough edges and material deterioration. Rough edges cause skin irritation to patient's foot. Deteriorated material compromises structural integrity creating safety hazard. Replacement necessary for safe wheelchair use." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"RA modifier missing"** - Modifier not included. Fix: Include RA modifier on claim. RA indicates "Replacement of a DME item" distinguishing from initial issue. K0042 requires RA modifier for all replacement billing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Can be repaired"** - If damage appears repairable. Fix: Document why repair not appropriate: "Footplate structural damage cannot be safely repaired. Repair would compromise footplate integrity creating ongoing safety risk. Repair materials not available for this wheelchair model. Replacement is appropriate and medically necessary solution." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific damage details** (location, extent, type) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **why cannot repair** (structural damage too severe, safety compromise) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Emphasize **safety or function impact** (not just cosmetic) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify warranty status** - must be outside warranty *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Include RA modifier** - required for replacement
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Check current codes availability** before ordering *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Provide **detailed damage description** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **warranty status** clearly
- **RA modifier** required
- Generally **no PA required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Damage description:** "Patient's [left/right/both] standard footplate [damaged/broken/worn] requiring replacement. Specific damage: [cracked footplate with structural failure risk at center, crack extends 3 inches / bent footplate affecting foot positioning, bent 15 degrees from normal / worn surface with rough edges causing skin irritation / broken mounting points causing instability / material deterioration compromising integrity]"
- **Cannot repair:** "Footplate cannot be repaired because [structural damage too severe for safe repair / repair would compromise footplate safety and integrity / repair materials not available for this model / repair cost exceeds replacement cost]. Replacement necessary."
- **Safety/function impact:** "Damaged footplate affects [safety/function] by [creating fall risk if footplate breaks during use / causing improper foot positioning from bent/deformed shape / causing skin irritation from rough/deteriorated surface / creating instability from damaged mounting]. Replacement necessary for safe wheelchair use."
- **Warranty status:** "Footplate outside manufacturer warranty. Wheelchair purchased [date]. Manufacturer warranty expired [date]. [If early replacement:] Early replacement necessary due to [heavy use pattern/accident damage/unusual wear - describe]."
