# E2387 - Foam Filled Caster Tire

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Tire Replacements - Foam Filled
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Foam-filled pneumatic caster tire for power wheelchair replacement. Puncture-proof tire created by filling pneumatic tire with foam instead of air. For front (caster) wheels only. Same construction as E2386 but for front wheels instead of rear drive wheels.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2387** (foam-filled caster): Pneumatic caster tire filled with foam - puncture-proof, front wheels
- **E2386** (foam-filled drive): Same construction but for rear drive wheels
- **E2384** (pneumatic caster): Air-filled caster tire - requires maintenance, can get flats
- **E2389** (solid foam caster): Solid foam construction - firmer ride than foam-filled
- **E2391/E2392** (solid rubber/plastic caster): Most durable option - longest lifespan

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document (Same as E2386)
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Front caster tires worn or damaged beyond safe use
3. Tires not under manufacturer warranty
4. Medical necessity for foam-filled vs. standard pneumatic tires

### Justification for Foam-Filled
- Use environment with high puncture risk (thorns, glass, sharp debris)
- Patient unable to maintain proper tire air pressure
- Patient requires maximum reliability (cannot risk flat tires)
- Consistency with drive wheel tire selection (if using foam-filled drive wheels E2386)

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each tire
- Typically 2 units (both front casters)
- Specify tire size and foam-filled construction

### Related Codes (Do NOT bill together with E2387)
- E2385 (tube for caster) - Not needed with foam-filled tires

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Same as E2386:** All requirements identical to E2386; only difference is wheel position (front vs. rear)
2. **Caster wheels:** Front wheels that swivel for steering - typically smaller than drive wheels
3. **No tube needed:** Foam-filled casters are complete units - do NOT bill E2385
4. **Typically matched:** If using foam-filled drive wheels (E2386), usually use foam-filled casters (E2387) for consistency
5. **Warranty verification:** Confirm tires not under manufacturer warranty before ordering

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation]. Front caster tires worn [describe wear pattern/damage]. Tires not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Foam-filled caster tires medically necessary due to [use environment with puncture hazards/inability to maintain air pressure/reliability requirements/consistency with drive wheel selection]. Standard pneumatic caster tires inappropriate due to [high flat tire risk/maintenance requirements/patient safety concerns]. Recommend replacement with foam-filled caster tires, size [specify], quantity 2 (both front casters)."
