# E2392 - Solid Rubber/Plastic Caster Tire with Integrated Wheel

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Tire Replacements - Solid Rubber/Plastic
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Solid rubber or solid plastic caster tire with integrated wheel for power wheelchair replacement. Tire and wheel manufactured as single inseparable unit. Most durable caster tire option. Provides maximum puncture resistance and longest service life. Firmest ride quality. For front (caster) wheels only. Includes wheel rim in replacement cost.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2392** (solid rubber/plastic integrated): Tire and wheel as single unit - most durable, includes wheel, typically more expensive
- **E2391** (solid rubber/plastic removable): Same durability but tire only (wheel separate) - less expensive if wheel functional
- **E2389** (solid foam caster): Very durable - firm ride, less durable than E2392
- **E2387** (foam-filled caster): Durable - medium cushioning, puncture-proof
- **E2384** (pneumatic caster): Least durable - best cushioning, requires maintenance
- **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic drive): Same durability but for rear wheels

## Integrated vs. Removable Design

### E2392 (Integrated) - Tire + Wheel Unit
- **Includes:** Tire and wheel as single inseparable unit
- **When tire worn:** Must replace entire tire/wheel assembly
- **When wheel damaged:** Must replace entire tire/wheel assembly
- **Cost:** Typically more expensive (includes wheel rim)
- **Use when:** Wheelchair uses integrated tire/wheel design, or wheel rim also needs replacement

### E2391 (Removable) - Tire Only
- **Includes:** Tire only (wheel rim not included)
- **When tire worn:** Can replace tire only, reuse wheel rim
- **When wheel damaged:** Must bill wheel separately
- **Cost:** Less expensive (tire only)
- **Use when:** Tire can be removed from wheel and wheel rim is still functional

## When to Use E2392 vs. E2391

### Use E2392 (Integrated) When:
1. Wheelchair manufacturer uses integrated caster tire/wheel design (tire cannot be removed from wheel)
2. Wheel rim is also damaged/worn and needs replacement
3. Integrated design is manufacturer's specification for this wheelchair model
4. More cost-effective to replace both tire and wheel together

### Use E2391 (Removable) When:
1. Tire can be removed from wheel rim
2. Wheel rim is still functional (not damaged or worn)
3. Only tire needs replacement
4. More cost-effective to replace tire only

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Front caster tire/wheel worn or damaged beyond safe use
3. Tire/wheel not under manufacturer warranty
4. Medical necessity for solid rubber/plastic vs. other tire types
5. Medical necessity for integrated tire/wheel design (why E2392 vs. E2391)

### Justification for E2392 (Integrated) vs. E2391 (Removable)
Document one of the following:
- Wheelchair manufacturer uses proprietary integrated tire/wheel design (tire cannot be separated from wheel)
- Wheel rim is also damaged/worn beyond safe use (must replace both tire and wheel)
- Manufacturer specification requires integrated tire/wheel assembly for this wheelchair model
- Integrated design necessary for proper wheelchair function

### Justification for Solid Rubber/Plastic
Same as E2390/E2391 - maximum durability, longest lifespan, maximum puncture resistance, zero maintenance requirements

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each unit (tire + wheel)
- Typically 2 units (both front casters)
- Specify tire size, solid rubber/plastic construction, and integrated tire/wheel design

### Important Billing Notes
- E2392 includes BOTH tire and wheel in one unit
- Do NOT bill wheel separately when using E2392
- E2392 typically higher cost than E2391 (includes wheel rim)

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required per LCD L33792
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA, but may require PA depending on cost (includes wheel)

## Special Considerations

1. **Integrated design:** Tire and wheel as single unit - cannot separate
2. **Includes wheel:** More expensive than E2391 but appropriate when wheel also needs replacement
3. **Most durable caster option:** Longest service life of all caster tire types (tied with E2391)
4. **Firmest ride:** Least cushioning - assess patient tolerance
5. **Completely maintenance-free:** No air pressure, no flats, no repairs
6. **Manufacturer-specific:** Some wheelchairs require integrated design - verify before ordering
7. **Cost justification:** Document why integrated unit necessary vs. tire-only replacement (E2391)
8. **Warranty verification:** Confirm tire/wheel not under manufacturer warranty before ordering

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation] with [describe heavy use pattern/extreme environment]. Front caster tire/wheel worn [describe wear pattern/damage to both tire and wheel OR integrated design]. Tire/wheel not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Wheelchair uses integrated caster tire/wheel design per manufacturer specification [specify manufacturer/model] - tire cannot be separated from wheel [OR wheel rim also damaged and needs replacement]. Solid rubber/plastic caster tire/wheel medically necessary due to [maximum durability requirements/consistency with drive wheel selection E2390/very heavy use pattern/extreme use environment]. Integrated tire/wheel unit (E2392) appropriate because [integrated design is manufacturer specification/wheel rim also needs replacement/cannot replace tire separately]. E2391 (removable tire only) not appropriate because [tire cannot be separated from wheel/wheel also needs replacement]. Patient requires longest service life and maximum puncture resistance. [Confirm patient tolerates firm ride]. Recommend replacement with solid rubber/plastic integrated caster tire/wheel units, size [specify], quantity 2 (both front casters)."
