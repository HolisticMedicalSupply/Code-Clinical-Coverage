# K0039 - Leg Strap, H-Style (Enhanced Stabilization)

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Leg Positioning and Safety - Enhanced
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

H-style leg strap for power wheelchair. Enhanced stabilization design for severe spasticity and strong involuntary movements. H-shaped configuration provides superior leg control compared to standard leg strap (K0038). Use when standard leg strap insufficient for patient's spasticity severity.

## H-Style Design

### H-Shaped Configuration
- **Design:** H-shaped strap pattern
- **Typical configuration:** Two horizontal straps (above and below calf) + connecting vertical strap(s)
- **Enhanced control:** Multiple contact points distribute stabilization forces
- **Advantage:** More secure leg containment for severe spasticity

### H-Style vs. Standard Strap

**K0039 (H-Style):**
- H-shaped configuration with multiple control points
- For severe spasticity and strong extensor patterns
- Enhanced stabilization and force distribution
- Use when K0038 insufficient

**K0038 (Standard):**
- Single strap around calf
- For mild to moderate spasticity
- Standard stabilization adequate for typical cases
- Try first before upgrading to K0039

**Selection approach:** Start with K0038 (standard). Only use K0039 (H-style) when K0038 proves insufficient or when severity clearly requires H-style from onset.

## Clinical Indications for H-Style

H-style leg strap indicated for:

### Severe Spasticity
- **Modified Ashworth Scale 3-4:** Strong muscle tone requiring enhanced control
- **Severe cerebral palsy:** G80.1-G80.9 with severe spasticity
- **Severe spinal cord injury:** G82.50-G82.54 (quadriplegia with severe spasticity)
- **Severe MS:** G35 (multiple sclerosis with significant spasticity)

### Strong Extensor Patterns
- Powerful involuntary leg extension movements
- Legs forcefully straighten, overcoming standard strap
- Strong enough to break or fail standard leg strap
- H-style provides additional control points

### Standard Strap Insufficient
- Tried K0038 but legs still slide off footrests
- K0038 doesn't contain involuntary movements adequately
- K0038 strap breaks or fails from force of spasticity
- Safety concerns continue despite K0038 use
- Clinical assessment shows H-style necessary from onset

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document (Same as K0038 PLUS Additional Requirements)

**Standard Requirements (K0038):**
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Specific condition causing need for leg stabilization
3. How condition affects foot positioning
4. Safety concerns without leg strap

**ADDITIONAL Requirements for K0039 (H-Style):**
5. **Spasticity severity:** Document severe spasticity requiring enhanced control
6. **Why K0038 insufficient:** Explain why standard leg strap inadequate
7. **PT/OT evaluation (recommended):** Professional assessment of spasticity and strap needs

### Justification for H-Style vs. Standard

Document ONE of the following:

**Option 1: Trial of Standard Strap**
- Patient previously used K0038 (standard leg strap)
- Standard strap proved insufficient: [legs still slide off / strap breaks from spasticity force / inadequate control]
- H-style strap necessary for adequate stabilization and safety

**Option 2: Severity Requires H-Style from Onset**
- Patient has severe spasticity [document severity: Modified Ashworth 3-4 / severe cerebral palsy / strong extensor patterns]
- Clinical assessment by [PT/OT/physician] indicates standard strap will be insufficient
- H-style strap medically necessary from onset based on spasticity severity

### PT/OT Evaluation

PT/OT evaluation recommended (not required) should document:
- Spasticity severity assessment (Modified Ashworth Scale or similar)
- Involuntary movement pattern description
- Comparison of standard vs. H-style effectiveness
- Safety assessment with different strap types
- Professional recommendation for H-style based on clinical findings

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue or when not included
- **RB modifier** for replacement orders

### Units
- Bill per each leg strap
- Order quantity based on patient need (1 or 2 straps)

### When Billable

**At initial issue:**
- If NOT included in wheelchair package
- Document medical necessity and H-style justification

**As replacement:**
- Original H-style leg strap worn or damaged
- RB modifier for replacement

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Enhanced design:** H-style for severe spasticity - K0038 for standard cases
2. **Justify vs. K0038:** Must explain why standard strap insufficient
3. **PT/OT recommended:** Evaluation strengthens medical necessity
4. **Spasticity severity:** Document using clinical scale if possible (Modified Ashworth)
5. **Try K0038 first:** If clinically appropriate, trial standard before H-style
6. **Same coverage as K0038:** No PA, no face-to-face required
7. **Safety focus:** Emphasize safety concerns with standard strap

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Diagnosis:** Patient has [severe spastic cerebral palsy G80.x / severe spinal cord injury with spasticity G82.50-G82.54 / severe multiple sclerosis with spasticity G35] with SEVERE spasticity requiring enhanced leg stabilization.

**Spasticity severity:** [PT/OT/Physician] assessment documents severe spasticity: [Modified Ashworth Scale 3-4 / strong muscle tone / powerful involuntary contractions / strong extensor patterns]. Patient experiences forceful involuntary leg extension causing feet to slide off footrests despite standard leg stabilization attempts.

**Why H-style needed (choose one):**

[Option 1 - Trial of standard:] Patient previously used standard leg strap (K0038) but proved insufficient. With K0038: [legs continued to slide off footrests multiple times daily / strap could not contain involuntary movements / strap broke from force of spasticity / safety concerns continued]. H-style leg strap with enhanced stabilization configuration necessary to provide adequate leg control.

[Option 2 - Severity from onset:] Based on severity of spasticity and strong extensor patterns, clinical assessment by [PT/OT/physician] indicates standard leg strap (K0038) will be insufficient for patient's needs. H-style leg strap with enhanced H-shaped configuration medically necessary from onset to provide adequate stabilization and safety.

**Safety concerns:** Without H-style leg strap, patient at risk for [foot injury from dragging / toe entrapment in wheelchair mechanism / loss of stability / fall risk from feet sliding off]. Enhanced stabilization of H-style strap necessary for safe wheelchair use.

**PT/OT evaluation:** [If available:] [PT/OT name] evaluated [date] and documented: [spasticity severity findings, H-style recommendation, safety assessment]. Evaluation supports medical necessity for H-style leg strap.

[If replacement: Original H-style leg strap worn/damaged [describe] requiring replacement. RB modifier for replacement.]

Recommend H-style leg strap, quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both legs]."
