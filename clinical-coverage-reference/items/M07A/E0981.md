- [ ] **RB modifier** (replacement - REQUIRED for Medicare)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 wheelchair dependence, Z74.09 reduced mobility)
- [ ] **Documentation of damage:**

- [ ] Proof not covered under warranty
- [ ] RB modifier on claim

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify "seat upholstery replacement"

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Within warranty period"** - Upholstery covered by manufacturer warranty. Fix: Verify warranty status. If within warranty, contact manufacturer for warranty replacement. Only bill E0981 if warranty expired or damage not covered under warranty terms. Provide documentation of warranty expiration date.

2. **"Missing RB modifier"** (Medicare) - Replacement billing without RB modifier. Fix: RB modifier REQUIRED for replacement billing. Add RB modifier to claim to indicate replacement of existing DME component.

3. **"Insufficient documentation of damage"** - Vague description of condition. Fix: Provide specific documentation: "Seat upholstery torn in 3 locations (6-inch tear left side, 4-inch tear center, 2-inch tear right front); foam exposed; cannot be repaired; replacement necessary for continued wheelchair use; warranty expired 10/15/2023."

4. **"Normal wear and tear during warranty"** - Damage occurred during warranty period. Fix: If damage is normal wear and tear during warranty, manufacturer responsible. Only bill payer if: (1) Warranty expired, OR (2) Damage beyond normal wear (e.g., burns, cuts, excessive soiling not covered by warranty terms). Document why manufacturer not responsible.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **RB modifier MANDATORY** for replacement billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify warranty status** - must be expired or damage not covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **specific damage** (tears, soiling, wear) with details *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **why cannot be repaired or cleaned** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Clearly state "**replacement**" in fiscal order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Description of damage** with specifics *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Warranty status documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Generally no PA needed for routine upholstery replacement

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Damage documentation**: "Seat upholstery severely torn with multiple rips (6-inch tear left lateral, 4-inch tear center seat, 2-inch tear right front edge); foam padding exposed; tears cannot be repaired; upholstery worn beyond useful life; replacement necessary for continued safe wheelchair use; original wheelchair delivered 06/15/2019, 5-year warranty expired 06/15/2024"
- **Soiling documentation**: "Seat upholstery soiled beyond cleaning due to incontinence over 3-year use; professional cleaning attempted without success; odor and staining persist; replacement necessary for hygiene and continued wheelchair use; warranty expired 2 years ago"
- **Safety need**: "Torn upholstery exposes sharp foam edges creating skin injury risk; tears catching on clothing; replacement necessary for safe wheelchair use"

## Related Codes

- **E0981** - Seat upholstery replacement (this code)
- **E0982** - Back upholstery replacement - for back upholstery (separate from seat)
- **K0108** - Wheelchair component/accessory NOS - for unlisted wheelchair components

**Note:** E0981 is SEAT upholstery. E0982 is BACK upholstery. Bill separately if both need replacement. Both require RB modifier for replacement billing.

## Warranty Considerations

**Check warranty status before billing:**
- Standard wheelchair warranties: typically 1-5 years depending on component
- Power wheelchair warranties: often 5 years on frame, shorter on upholstery
- Damage covered under warranty: manufacturer responsible
- Normal wear beyond warranty period: payer covers replacement

**Only bill payer when:**
- Warranty expired
- OR damage not covered under warranty terms (e.g., cuts, burns, excessive soiling)

**If within warranty:** Contact wheelchair manufacturer for warranty replacement.
