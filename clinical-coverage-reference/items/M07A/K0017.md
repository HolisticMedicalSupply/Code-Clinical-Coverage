# K0017 - Detachable Adjustable Height Armrest Base

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Armrests - Detachable and Adjustable
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Detachable armrest for power wheelchair with adjustable height. Combines two features: (1) removable for transfers, and (2) height adjustable for positioning. Complete armrest base unit. Upper portion (K0018) can be replaced separately if worn.

## Armrest Feature Comparison

### K0017 (Detachable + Adjustable Height)
- **Detachable:** YES - for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** YES - for positioning
- **Use when:** Need BOTH features (transfers AND height adjustment)

### K0015 (Detachable Only)
- **Detachable:** YES - for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** NO - fixed height
- **Use when:** Need detachable but standard height adequate

### K0020 (Adjustable Height Only)
- **Detachable:** NO - fixed to wheelchair
- **Height adjustable:** YES - for positioning
- **Use when:** Need height adjustment but NOT detachable

### K0017 vs. Alternatives

**Choose K0017 when patient needs BOTH:**
1. Armrest removal capability (for side transfers)
2. Height adjustment capability (for desk clearance, positioning, variable activities)

**Choose K0015 when:**
- Patient needs armrest removal for transfers
- Standard fixed height adequate (no height adjustment needed)
- More economical option

**Choose K0020 when:**
- Patient needs height adjustment for positioning/desk clearance
- Armrest removal NOT needed (no side transfers)

## Adjustable Height Applications

Height adjustment accommodates:
- **Desk clearance:** Lower armrest to slide under desk/table for work, meals, computer use
- **Variable positioning:** Different heights for different activities throughout day
- **Growth accommodation:** Adjust height as child grows (pediatric wheelchairs)
- **Optimal arm support:** Fine-tune armrest height for comfort and function
- **Transfer assistance:** May adjust height to facilitate certain transfer techniques

## K0017 Components

### Complete Armrest (K0017)
- Base structure with height adjustment mechanism
- Detachment mechanism for transfers
- Upper armrest portion with arm pad
- Bill K0017 for complete armrest (initial issue or full replacement)

### Upper Portion (K0018) - Replacement Only
- Top part of armrest that may wear over time
- Can be replaced separately if base still functional
- Bill K0018 when only upper portion needs replacement (more economical than full K0017)

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document BOTH Features

**1. Detachable Feature (Transfer Needs):**
- Patient performs side transfers requiring armrest removal
- Transfer frequency and destinations (bed, car, toilet, etc.)
- Transfer technique (independent/assisted)
- Fixed armrests would block transfer path

**2. Adjustable Height Feature (Positioning Needs):**
- Variable height needs throughout day
- Desk/table clearance requirements
- Different armrest heights for different activities
- Specific positioning needs requiring height adjustment
- Growth accommodation (pediatric cases)

### Justification for K0017 vs. Simpler Options

Must justify why BOTH features needed:
- K0015 inadequate because: [patient needs height adjustment for desk clearance/positioning]
- K0020 inadequate because: [patient needs armrest removal for side transfers]
- K0017 necessary because: [patient requires both transfer capability and height adjustment]

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue or when not included
- **KU modifier** may apply with complex rehab wheelchairs
- **RB modifier** if billing as replacement

### Units
- Bill per each armrest base
- Typically order pair: 2 units (left and right armrest bases)
- One pair per wheelchair

### Related Billing

**Full armrest replacement:** Bill K0017 (complete base)
**Upper portion only replacement:** Bill K0018 (if base functional)
**Arm pad only replacement:** Bill K0019 (cushioning pad)

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** May require PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Two features:** Must justify BOTH detachable and adjustable height features
2. **More complex:** Typically more expensive than K0015 or K0020 alone
3. **Included in some packages:** Common in complex rehab wheelchairs
4. **Upper portion replaceable:** K0018 available for upper portion replacement if base functional
5. **Pair recommended:** Typically order both armrests (2 units) for symmetry
6. **KU modifier:** May apply with complex rehab wheelchairs
7. **Arm pads separate:** K0019 (arm pad) is separate component

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Transfer needs (detachable feature):** Patient performs [independent/assisted] side transfers to/from wheelchair [frequency] to [destinations]. Transfer technique requires removal of armrests to [facilitate sliding transfer/allow close positioning]. Fixed armrests would block transfer path.

**Positioning needs (adjustable height feature):** Patient requires variable armrest heights for: [desk/table clearance for work/meals/computer use; different activities throughout day requiring different arm positions; optimal positioning for comfort and function; growth accommodation]. Standard fixed height armrest inadequate because [patient uses desk requiring lower armrest height; needs different heights for different activities; growing child requires periodic height adjustment].

**Justification for K0017:** K0015 (detachable non-adjustable) inadequate because patient requires height adjustability for [positioning/desk clearance/growth]. K0020 (fixed adjustable height) inadequate because patient requires armrest removal for side transfers. K0017 (detachable adjustable height) medically necessary to accommodate both transfer needs and positioning needs.

[If at initial issue: Wheelchair configuration does not include detachable adjustable height armrests.] [If replacement: Original armrests damaged/worn - reasonable replacement needed.] Recommend detachable adjustable height armrest bases, quantity 2 (one pair - left and right)."
