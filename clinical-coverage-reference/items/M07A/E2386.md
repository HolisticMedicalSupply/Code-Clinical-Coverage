  field_notes:
    foam_filled_construction: "FOAM-FILLED tires are PNEUMATIC TIRES that have been filled with foam instead of air. NOT same as solid foam tires (E2388). Foam-filled = puncture-proof pneumatic tire. Process: standard pneumatic tire is filled with liquid foam that hardens, eliminating need for air and preventing flats. Provides puncture resistance while maintaining some cushioning properties of pneumatic tires. (Under Review - High Confidence)"
    foam_filled_vs_pneumatic: "Foam-filled tires (E2386) vs. pneumatic tires (E2381): Foam-filled eliminates flat tire risk, requires no maintenance (no air pressure checks), puncture-proof, but heavier weight and slightly harder ride than air-filled pneumatic. Must justify why foam-filled needed vs. standard pneumatic - typically based on use environment (rough terrain, puncture hazards like thorns/glass, inability to maintain air pressure). (Under Review - High Confidence)"
    foam_filled_vs_solid_foam: "E2386 (foam-filled) vs. E2388 (solid foam): Foam-filled (E2386) starts as pneumatic tire filled with foam. Solid foam (E2388) is manufactured as solid foam from start - no pneumatic tire involved. Foam-filled typically provides better cushioning than solid foam. Both are puncture-proof. (Under Review - High Confidence)"
    no_tube_insert_needed: "CRITICAL: Foam-filled tires do NOT require separate tube (E2382) or insert (E2383) codes. Foam-filled tire is complete unit. Do not bill E2382 or E2383 with foam-filled tires. Only pneumatic tires (E2381) use tubes/inserts. (Under Review - High Confidence)"
    drive_wheel_position: "Drive wheel tires (E2386) are REAR wheels - the large powered wheels that propel the wheelchair. Different from caster tires (E2387) which are front wheels. Typically need 2 drive wheel tires (one for each rear wheel). (Verified - High Confidence)"
    replacement_only: "CRITICAL: E2386 is for REPLACEMENT tires only, NOT for initial wheelchair issue. Tires included with wheelchair at initial issue. Component becomes replacement part when original tires worn out or damaged. RB modifier required to indicate replacement. (Verified - High Confidence)"

# E2386 - Foam Filled Drive Wheel Tire

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Tire Replacements - Foam Filled
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Foam-filled pneumatic drive wheel tire for power wheelchair replacement. Puncture-proof tire created by filling pneumatic tire with foam instead of air. Eliminates flat tire risk while maintaining cushioning properties. For rear (drive) wheels only.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2386** (foam-filled): Pneumatic tire filled with foam - puncture-proof, no maintenance
- **E2381** (pneumatic): Air-filled tire - best cushioning, requires maintenance, can get flats
- **E2388** (solid foam): Solid foam construction - puncture-proof, firmer ride than foam-filled
- **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic): Most durable option - longest lifespan, firmest ride
- **E2387** (foam-filled caster): Same as E2386 but for front wheels

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Drive wheel tires worn or damaged beyond safe use
3. Tires not under manufacturer warranty
4. Medical necessity for foam-filled vs. standard pneumatic tires

### Justification for Foam-Filled (E2386) vs. Pneumatic (E2381)
- Use environment with high puncture risk (thorns, glass, sharp debris, rough terrain)
- Patient unable to maintain proper tire air pressure
- Patient requires maximum reliability (cannot risk flat tires)
- Patient has mobility needs that cannot accommodate tire maintenance/repairs

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each tire
- Typically 2 units (both drive wheels)
- Specify tire size and foam-filled construction

### Related Codes (Do NOT bill together with E2386)
- E2382 (tube) - Not needed with foam-filled tires
- E2383 (insert) - Not needed with foam-filled tires
- E2394 (wheel rim) - Bill separately if wheel also replaced

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **No tube/insert needed:** Foam-filled tires are complete units - do NOT bill E2382 or E2383
2. **Weight consideration:** Foam-filled tires heavier than pneumatic - may slightly reduce range
3. **Maintenance-free:** No air pressure checks, no flat repairs needed
4. **Warranty verification:** Confirm tires not under manufacturer warranty before ordering
5. **Drive wheels only:** This code for rear (powered) wheels; use E2387 for front casters

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation]. Drive wheel tires worn [describe wear pattern/damage]. Tires not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Foam-filled tires medically necessary due to [use environment with puncture hazards/inability to maintain air pressure/reliability requirements]. Standard pneumatic tires inappropriate due to [high flat tire risk/maintenance requirements/patient safety concerns]. Recommend replacement with foam-filled drive wheel tires, size [specify], quantity 2 (both drive wheels)."
