# E2210 - Wheelchair Bearings (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E2210 represents replacement bearings for wheelchairs. Bearings are wear components that allow smooth rotation of wheels, casters, and other moving parts. This code is for REPLACEMENT only when bearings are worn, damaged, or affecting wheelchair function outside of warranty coverage.

**CRITICAL:** E2210 is for REPLACEMENT bearings only, NOT for initial wheelchair issue. Bearings are included with wheelchair at initial issue. Separately billable only as replacement when worn/damaged outside warranty period.

**Key Features:**
- Replacement bearings for wheelchair wheels, casters, or axles
- Any type of bearing (ball bearings, roller bearings, sealed bearings, etc.)
- Billed per each bearing
- For wheelchairs outside warranty period
- Can be for manual or power wheelchairs

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Manual wheelchair bearings worn from heavy use requiring replacement
- Power wheelchair caster bearings damaged affecting steering and safety
- Wheel bearings creating noise, resistance, or impaired function
- Replacement needed to restore safe wheelchair operation

- [ ] RB modifier for replacement

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**

- [ ] Number of bearings needed

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Under warranty"** - Bearings should be covered by wheelchair warranty. Fix: Document wheelchair outside warranty period: "Patient's manual wheelchair purchased 4 years ago in 2021; standard wheelchair warranty expired after 1 year; wheelchair now outside warranty period; front wheel bearings worn and creating resistance affecting patient's ability to propel wheelchair; replacement bearings not covered under warranty; E2210 bearing replacement medically necessary to restore wheelchair function."

2. **"Problem not documented"** - Missing description of bearing failure. Fix: Provide specific description of bearing problem and functional impact: "Patient reports loud grinding noise from left rear wheel bearing; wheel has visible wobble; bearing wear creates resistance making wheelchair difficult to propel; patient fatigues quickly due to increased propulsion effort; bearing replacement necessary to restore smooth wheel rotation and reduce propulsion effort for safe wheelchair use."

3. **"No RB modifier"** - Missing replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier for replacement parts: "E2210 billed with RB modifier indicating replacement of wheelchair component. RB modifier required for bearing replacement per Medicare policy."

4. **"Number of bearings unclear"** - Vague order without quantity. Fix: Specify exactly which and how many bearings need replacement: "Patient requires replacement of 4 front caster bearings (2 casters x 2 bearings each); front casters have bearing failure with noise and wobble affecting steering; order 4 units of E2210 with RB modifier for 4 bearing replacements."

5. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Unclear why replacement needed. Fix: Link bearing failure to wheelchair function and patient safety: "Patient's power wheelchair right front caster bearing seized causing caster to drag instead of rotate; this creates unsafe turning (wheelchair pulls to right) and excessive battery drain; patient unable to steer wheelchair safely; bearing replacement medically necessary to restore safe wheelchair steering and function."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document bearing failure/wear specifically** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Proof outside warranty period** (wheelchair age, purchase date) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **RB modifier REQUIRED** for replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Functional impact description** (noise, resistance, safety issue) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Specify number of bearings** needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Simple replacement part - minimal documentation required

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Description of failure/wear** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Warranty status documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Generally no PA for minor replacement parts

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Bearing wear with functional impact**: "Patient uses manual wheelchair for all mobility (community ambulator unable to walk); wheelchair purchased 3 years ago (2022), outside warranty period; bilateral rear wheel bearings worn causing significant wheel resistance; patient reports difficulty propelling wheelchair and shoulder pain from increased effort; bearing examination shows roughness and audible grinding; bearing replacement necessary to restore smooth wheel rotation and reduce propulsion effort preventing shoulder injury"

- **Power wheelchair bearing failure**: "Patient's power wheelchair (purchased 2019, outside warranty) has left front caster bearing failure; caster drags instead of rotating freely; creates unsafe steering (pulls left unexpectedly); excessive battery drain (50% reduction in range); patient unable to drive wheelchair safely; caster bearing replacement medically necessary to restore safe wheelchair steering and function; order 2 units E2210 (left front caster has 2 bearings) with RB modifier"

- **Multiple bearing replacement**: "Patient's manual wheelchair has bearing wear in all 4 wheels from heavy daily use (patient uses wheelchair 12-14 hours daily for work); wheelchair 5 years old, outside warranty; all wheel bearings show excessive play and noise; significant propulsion resistance noted; patient fatigues quickly; replacing all 8 wheel bearings (4 wheels x 2 bearings each) necessary to restore wheelchair function and reduce propulsion effort; order 8 units E2210 with RB modifier for 8 bearing replacements"

- **Safety issue**: "Patient's power wheelchair right rear wheel bearing seized; wheel wobbles significantly; audible metal-on-metal grinding; unsafe for continued use due to instability; patient at risk for fall if bearing completely fails during use; bearing replacement medically necessary for safe wheelchair operation; cannot use wheelchair until bearing replaced creating mobility emergency; order E2210 with RB modifier for bearing replacement"

## Related Codes

- **E2210** - Bearings, replacement only (this code)
- **E2211** - Foam filled caster tire - different replacement part
- **E2212** - Foam filled wheel tire - different replacement part
- **E2227** - Wheel assembly - for complete wheel replacement (not just bearing)
- **E2228** - Caster assembly - for complete caster replacement (not just bearing)
- **K0108** - Wheelchair component/accessory NOS - for unlisted parts

**Note:** E2210 is for BEARINGS only. For complete wheel/caster replacement, use E2227/E2228. For tires, use E2211/E2212.

## RB Modifier - Replacement of Part

**RB Modifier Definition:**
"Replacement of a part of a DME, orthotic or prosthetic device furnished as part of a repair"

**When to Use RB Modifier:**
- Replacing component of existing wheelchair
- Part being replaced, not entire item
- Examples: bearings, tires, armrests, footrests, cushions (replacement only)

**E2210 ALWAYS requires RB modifier** - bearings are replacement parts only, never initial issue.
