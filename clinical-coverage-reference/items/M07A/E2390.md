# E2390 - Solid Rubber/Plastic Drive Wheel Tire

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Tire Replacements - Solid Rubber/Plastic
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Solid rubber or solid plastic drive wheel tire for power wheelchair replacement. Most durable tire option available. Provides maximum puncture resistance and longest service life. Firmest ride quality with least cushioning. For rear (drive) wheels only.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic): Most durable option - longest lifespan, firmest ride, maximum puncture resistance
- **E2388** (solid foam): Very durable - good lifespan, firm ride, puncture-proof
- **E2386** (foam-filled): Durable - medium cushioning, puncture-proof
- **E2381** (pneumatic): Least durable - best cushioning, requires maintenance, can get flats
- **E2391/E2392** (solid rubber/plastic caster): Same durability but for front wheels

## Tire Selection Guide

### Durability Hierarchy (Least to Most Durable)
1. **E2381** (pneumatic) - Shortest lifespan, can puncture
2. **E2386** (foam-filled) - Good durability, puncture-proof
3. **E2388** (solid foam) - Very durable, puncture-proof
4. **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic) - **MOST DURABLE**, longest lifespan

### Ride Quality Hierarchy (Softest to Firmest)
1. **E2381** (pneumatic) - Softest ride, best shock absorption
2. **E2386** (foam-filled) - Medium cushioning
3. **E2388** (solid foam) - Firm support
4. **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic) - **FIRMEST**, least cushioning

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Drive wheel tires worn or damaged beyond safe use
3. Tires not under manufacturer warranty
4. Medical necessity for solid rubber/plastic vs. other tire types

### Justification for Solid Rubber/Plastic (E2390)
Choose E2390 when patient requires:
- **Maximum durability:** Very heavy daily use, extreme use environment
- **Longest lifespan:** Cost-effectiveness over time, reduced replacement frequency
- **Maximum puncture resistance:** Severe puncture hazards in use environment
- **Zero maintenance:** Patient cannot check air pressure or perform any tire maintenance
- **Reliability:** Cannot tolerate any flat tire risk (critical mobility needs)
- **History:** Frequent tire wear or damage with other tire types

### Consider Patient Tolerance
- Firmest ride quality - may transmit more vibration to patient
- Patient must tolerate firm ride (assess patient's comfort, existing seating cushioning)
- Patient with pressure concerns may need enhanced seating cushion

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each tire
- Typically 2 units (both drive wheels)
- Specify tire size and solid rubber/plastic construction

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Most durable option:** Longest service life of all tire types
2. **Firmest ride:** Least cushioning - assess patient tolerance
3. **Completely maintenance-free:** No air pressure, no flats, no repairs
4. **Maximum puncture resistance:** Cannot be penetrated by sharp objects
5. **Cost-effective long-term:** Higher initial cost but longer lifespan may reduce total cost
6. **Drive wheels only:** This code for rear (powered) wheels; use E2391/E2392 for front casters
7. **Warranty verification:** Confirm tires not under manufacturer warranty before ordering

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation] with [describe heavy use pattern/extreme environment]. Drive wheel tires worn [describe wear pattern/damage]. Tires not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Solid rubber/plastic tires medically necessary due to [maximum durability requirements/very heavy use pattern/extreme use environment with severe puncture hazards/history of frequent tire wear]. Patient requires longest service life and maximum puncture resistance. [Confirm patient tolerates firm ride/enhanced seating cushion provides adequate comfort]. Less durable tire options inappropriate due to [insufficient lifespan/puncture risk/maintenance requirements]. Recommend replacement with solid rubber/plastic drive wheel tires, size [specify], quantity 2 (both drive wheels)."
