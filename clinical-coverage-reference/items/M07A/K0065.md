# K0065 - Spoke Protectors

## Clinical Overview

K0065 represents spoke protectors for manual wheelchair rear wheels. These are plastic discs or solid covers that mount on the wheels to cover the spokes, preventing hand/finger injuries during self-propulsion and protecting clothing from spoke damage.

**Key Features:**
- Cover wheel spokes for safety
- Prevent hand/finger injuries during self-propulsion
- Protect clothing from spoke damage
- Safety accessory for manual wheelchair users who self-propel
- Billed per each (typically 2 needed for both rear wheels)

**Medical Necessity:** Based on SAFETY for self-propulsion. Must document beneficiary self-propels.

## Understanding Spoke Protectors

### What Are Spoke Protectors?

**Physical Description:**
- Plastic disc or solid cover
- Mounts on rear wheel between rim and hub
- Covers spokes completely
- Attaches to wheel with clips or fasteners

**Purpose:**
- **Safety:** Prevent hand/finger injuries from spokes during self-propulsion
- **Clothing protection:** Prevent clothing damage from spoke contact
- **Appearance:** Provide clean, covered look (secondary benefit)

### When Are They Medically Necessary?

**Covered (Medically Necessary):**
- Beneficiary self-propels manual wheelchair using hand rims
- Hands contact wheel area during propulsion
- Risk of finger injury from spokes during propulsion
- Active wheelchair user requiring safety device

**NOT Covered (Not Medically Necessary):**
- Patient does not self-propel (dependent)
- Uses power wheelchair (no hand propulsion)
- Pushed by caregiver only (no self-propulsion)
- Cosmetic request only (no safety medical necessity)

### Typical Configuration:

**Standard:** 2 spoke protectors (one for each rear wheel)
- Protects both sides during bilateral arm propulsion
- Standard setup for self-propellers

**Single:** 1 spoke protector (one rear wheel only)
- May be appropriate for hemiplegia with one-arm propulsion
- Less common configuration

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0065 - Spoke protectors, each"**
- [ ] **Quantity:** Number needed (typically 2 for both rear wheels)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3, G82.xx, G81.xx, G80.xx, M62.81)
- [ ] **Documentation that beneficiary self-propels:**
  - [ ] Patient independently propels manual wheelchair using arms/hands
  - [ ] Hands contact wheel rim area during propulsion
  - [ ] Active wheelchair user (not dependent/passive)
- [ ] **Medical necessity for spoke protection:**
  - [ ] Risk of hand/finger injury from spokes during self-propulsion
  - [ ] Safety device to prevent injuries
  - [ ] Protection during active wheelchair use
- [ ] NU modifier for new spoke protectors
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document self-propulsion capability and frequency
- [ ] Medical necessity for spoke protection (safety)
- [ ] Verify not included in initial wheelchair package (if billing separately)

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Same as Medicare requirements
- [ ] Signed fiscal order
- [ ] Documentation of self-propulsion and need

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Beneficiary does not self-propel"** - No documentation of self-propulsion. Fix: Must clearly document that beneficiary self-propels manual wheelchair using arms/hands. Example: "Patient independently propels manual wheelchair using bilateral arm propulsion. Self-propels for all indoor and outdoor mobility. Hands contact wheel rim during propulsion creating risk of finger injury from spokes. Spoke protectors medically necessary for safety during self-propulsion." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Not medically necessary"** - Vague or cosmetic justification. Fix: Frame as SAFETY device, not appearance. Document injury risk during self-propulsion. Example: "Patient self-propels manual wheelchair daily. Risk of hand/finger injury from exposed spokes during propulsion. Spoke protectors medically necessary as safety device to prevent injuries. Patient actively uses wheelchair for mobility requiring spoke protection." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Already included in initial wheelchair"** - Cannot bill separately if included. Fix: Verify whether spoke protectors included in initial wheelchair configuration. If included, cannot bill separately at initial. Only bill separately for replacement or if not included in initial package. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Patient uses power wheelchair"** - Power wheelchair users don't need spoke protectors. Fix: K0065 is for MANUAL wheelchair users who self-propel. If patient uses power wheelchair with hand controls (not hand rim propulsion), spoke protectors not medically necessary. Verify manual wheelchair use and self-propulsion. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document self-propulsion clearly** - "Patient independently propels manual wheelchair using arms/hands" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Emphasize SAFETY** - Frame as injury prevention, not cosmetic *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Specify frequency of use** - "Patient self-propels daily for all mobility" shows medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Injury risk** - "Risk of finger injury from exposed spokes during propulsion" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- NU modifier for new
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- Same documentation as Medicare
- Generally no PA required (simple accessory)
- Fiscal order required
- Document self-propulsion and need

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Self-propulsion:** "Patient independently propels manual wheelchair using bilateral arm propulsion. Self-propels for all indoor and outdoor mobility. Hands contact wheel rim during propulsion."
- **Medical necessity (safety):** "Spoke protectors medically necessary as safety device to prevent hand/finger injuries from exposed spokes during self-propulsion. Patient actively uses wheelchair daily, creating risk of injury without spoke protection."
