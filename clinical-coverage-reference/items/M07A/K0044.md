# K0044 - Footrest Upper Hanger Bracket (Replacement)

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Footrest Components - Replacement
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Upper hanger bracket for power wheelchair footrest replacement. Top mounting component that attaches to wheelchair frame and holds lower extension tube. KX and RB modifiers required. BUNDLED at initial - FOR REPLACEMENT ONLY.

## Footrest Component System

Power wheelchair footrest consists of:

### From Top to Bottom:
1. **K0044 - Upper hanger bracket (this code):** Attaches to wheelchair frame, holds lower tube
2. **K0043 - Lower extension tube:** Slides through bracket for height adjustment
3. **K0042 - Footplate:** Attaches to bottom of tube, supports foot

### Complete Assembly:
- **K0045 - Footrest complete assembly:** All components together (when multiple parts damaged)

## Upper Hanger Bracket Function

### What It Does:
- **Attaches:** Secures footrest system to wheelchair frame
- **Holds:** Contains lower extension tube (K0043)
- **Enables:** Allows tube to slide up/down for height adjustment
- **Secures:** Clamps/locks tube at desired height
- **Supports:** Bears weight and stress from footrest use

### Importance:
- Structural connection between footrest and wheelchair
- Critical for lower extremity positioning
- Maintains footrest stability and safety
- Enables proper leg angle adjustment

## CRITICAL: Bundled at Initial / Replacement Only

**K0044 BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue:**
- INCLUDED in base wheelchair price
- CANNOT bill K0044 when delivering new wheelchair
- Bundled with wheelchair bases and elevating legrests

**K0044 billable ONLY as replacement:**
- Only when replacing damaged bracket on existing wheelchair
- Must be outside manufacturer warranty
- KX and RB modifiers required

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document for Replacement
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Upper hanger bracket worn, damaged, or broken
3. Specific damage description
4. Damage cannot be repaired safely
5. Patient requires functional footrest for proper lower extremity positioning
6. Bracket outside manufacturer warranty

### Damage Documentation

Document specific damage:

**Structural Damage:**
- Cracked or broken bracket (structural failure)
- Bent bracket (misalignment, improper fit)
- Metal fatigue or failure
- Welded joint separated

**Functional Damage:**
- Worn clamping mechanism (doesn't secure tube properly)
- Stripped threads (can't tighten securely)
- Mounting points damaged (won't attach to wheelchair securely)
- Worn sliding surface (tube doesn't adjust smoothly)

**Why cannot repair:**
- Structural damage too severe for safe repair
- Broken bracket cannot be safely welded for weight-bearing
- Worn threads cannot be restored
- Repair would compromise patient safety

**How affects function:**
- Footrest unstable with damaged bracket
- Cannot securely hold lower extension tube
- Improper footrest positioning from bent/damaged bracket
- Safety hazard from structural compromise

### Warranty Documentation

**CRITICAL:** Must document outside warranty
- Verify warranty end date
- If within warranty, pursue warranty claim with manufacturer
- If outside warranty, document warranty expiration date

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers

**Both modifiers required:**
- **KX** (required) - Requirements specified in medical policy have been met
- **RB** (required for replacement) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each bracket
- Order quantity based on need:
  - 1 bracket (single footrest bracket damaged)
  - 2 brackets (both footrest brackets damaged)

### KX Modifier Purpose

KX modifier indicates:
- Medical necessity criteria documented
- Requirements for wheelchair accessory met
- Proper lower extremity positioning need established

### RB vs. RA Modifier

**K0044 uses RB modifier:**
- RB = Replacement of PART of DME item
- Upper hanger bracket is part of footrest system

**Contrast with K0043 (RA modifier):**
- RA = Replacement of complete DME ITEM
- Lower extension tube treated as complete item

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Varies by case - required for power wheelchair accessories

## Special Considerations

1. **BUNDLED at initial:** Cannot bill when delivering new wheelchair - included in base price
2. **Replacement only:** Only billable as replacement on existing wheelchair
3. **KX and RB modifiers:** Both required for proper billing
4. **Face-to-face only with new PWC:** Not required for replacement alone
5. **Warranty critical:** Must be outside manufacturer warranty
6. **Component vs. complete:** Consider K0045 if multiple footrest components damaged
7. **NY Medicaid variability:** PA requirements may vary by case - verify with payer

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Upper hanger bracket damage:** [Left/Right/Both] footrest upper hanger bracket [damaged/broken/worn] requiring replacement. Specific damage: [cracked bracket creating structural failure risk/worn clamping mechanism - cannot secure lower extension tube properly/stripped threads - cannot tighten securely/bent bracket causing misalignment and instability].

**Cannot be repaired:** Upper hanger bracket cannot be repaired because [structural damage too severe for safe repair/broken bracket cannot be safely welded for weight-bearing function/worn threads cannot be restored/worn clamping mechanism cannot be rebuilt]. Replacement necessary.

**Functional impact:** Damaged upper hanger bracket affects footrest function by [cannot securely hold lower extension tube/footrest unstable and unsafe/improper lower extremity positioning from bracket misalignment/safety hazard from structural compromise]. Patient requires functional upper hanger bracket for proper lower extremity positioning and safe wheelchair use.

**Medical necessity:** Patient requires proper lower extremity positioning with functional footrest system for [wheelchair mobility/safe seating/leg support during daily wheelchair use]. Damaged bracket prevents proper footrest function. KX modifier: medical necessity requirements met.

**Warranty status:** Upper hanger bracket outside manufacturer warranty. Wheelchair purchased [date]. Manufacturer warranty expired [date]. [Verify warranty documentation if available.]

**Replacement vs. initial:** This is REPLACEMENT of damaged bracket on existing wheelchair (not new wheelchair delivery). Original bracket included with wheelchair at initial issue. RB modifier for replacement of part.

**Other components:** [If only bracket damaged:] Lower extension tube (K0043) and footplate (K0042) remain functional - bracket-only replacement (K0044) appropriate. [If multiple components damaged:] Multiple footrest components damaged - consider complete footrest assembly (K0045) if more cost-effective.

Recommend footrest upper hanger bracket replacement (K0044), quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both], KX and RB modifiers."
