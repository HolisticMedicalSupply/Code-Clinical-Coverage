# K0044 - Footrest Upper Hanger Bracket (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

K0044 represents the upper hanger bracket component of power wheelchair footrest system for **REPLACEMENT ONLY**. This is the top mounting component that attaches to wheelchair frame and holds the lower extension tube, enabling footrest height adjustment. Upper hanger brackets are BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue with wheelchair bases and elevating legrests and **cannot be billed separately at initial delivery**. K0044 is only billable as replacement when original bracket becomes worn, damaged, or broken.

**Key Features:**
- Top mounting bracket attaching to wheelchair frame
- Holds lower extension tube (K0043) for height adjustment
- Enables footrest stability and positioning
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue

**REPLACEMENT ONLY:** Upper hanger bracket is BUNDLED at initial with wheelchair bases and elevating legrests. K0044 cannot be billed when delivering new wheelchair - only as replacement when damaged.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Covered:** Yes (REPLACEMENT ONLY)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Medical necessity documentation** for functional footrest with upper hanger bracket
- **Documentation of bracket wear or damage** requiring replacement
- **Documentation that bracket cannot be repaired** safely
- **KX modifier required** - requirements in medical policy have been met
- **RB modifier required** - replacement of part of DME item

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Required ONLY with new power wheelchair, NOT for replacement alone *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** As needed per damaged bracket (typically 1 or 2 depending on how many footrest brackets damaged) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - BUNDLED at initial with wheelchair bases and elevating legrests
- Cannot bill at initial wheelchair delivery - included in base wheelchair
- KX and RB modifiers both required for proper billing
- PT/OT evaluation not required for replacement
- RESNA ATP not required for replacement
- Face-to-face only if bracket part of NEW wheelchair order, not for replacement on existing wheelchair

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Covered:** Yes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Requirements:**
- **Prior authorization required** for power wheelchair accessories *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Fiscal order** from physician required
- **Medical necessity documentation** required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for replacement accessory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** As needed per damaged bracket *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Source indicates PA "varies by case" but "required for power wheelchair accessories"
- Verify PA requirements with payer for specific case
- Same documentation requirements as Medicare

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Footrest Component System

### Component Hierarchy (Top to Bottom):
1. **K0044 - Upper hanger bracket (this code):** Attaches to wheelchair frame, holds lower tube
2. **K0043 - Lower extension tube:** Slides through bracket for height adjustment
3. **K0042 - Footplate:** Attaches to bottom of tube, supports foot

### Complete Assembly:
- **K0045 - Footrest complete assembly:** All components together (when multiple parts damaged)

### Upper Hanger Bracket Function

**What It Does:**
- Attaches to wheelchair frame as structural mounting point
- Holds lower extension tube (K0043)
- Enables tube to slide up/down for height adjustment
- Clamps/locks tube at desired height
- Supports weight and stress from footrest use

**Importance:**
- Structural connection between footrest and wheelchair
- Critical for lower extremity positioning
- Maintains footrest stability and safety
- Enables proper leg angle adjustment

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0044 - Footrest, upper hanger bracket, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] **KX modifier** (medical necessity requirements met)
- [ ] **RB modifier** (replacement of part)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3, Z74.09, R26.2)
- [ ] **Detailed description of bracket damage:**
  - [ ] Type of damage: cracked, broken, bent, worn clamping mechanism, stripped threads
  - [ ] How damage affects function
  - [ ] Functional impact on footrest positioning
- [ ] **Documentation that bracket cannot be repaired safely**
- [ ] **Medical necessity for proper lower extremity positioning**
- [ ] **Quantity needed:** 1 or 2 brackets (specify which footrest: left/right/both)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document specific damage requiring replacement
- [ ] Explain why repair not possible or safe
- [ ] Document medical necessity for functional footrest system
- [ ] Include KX and RB modifiers

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order + PA):**
- [ ] Obtain prior authorization for power wheelchair accessory
- [ ] Same documentation as Medicare
- [ ] Medical necessity for proper lower extremity positioning

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial wheelchair delivery"** - Attempting to bill K0044 with new wheelchair. Fix: Do NOT bill K0044 at initial wheelchair issue - upper hanger bracket is BUNDLED with wheelchair base and elevating legrests. Only bill K0044 as replacement on existing wheelchair.

2. **"Missing KX or RB modifier"** - Billed without required modifiers. Fix: Both KX and RB modifiers are required. KX indicates medical necessity requirements met. RB indicates replacement of part of DME item.

3. **"Repair possible, replacement not medically necessary"** - Insufficient justification that bracket cannot be repaired. Fix: Document specifically why repair is not possible or safe: "Cracked bracket cannot be safely welded for weight-bearing function" or "Worn clamping mechanism cannot be rebuilt - replacement necessary."

4. **"Insufficient documentation of medical necessity"** - Vague justification for replacement. Fix: Document medical necessity for proper lower extremity positioning: "Patient requires functional footrest system for proper lower extremity positioning during wheelchair use. Damaged bracket prevents secure footrest attachment, creating safety hazard and improper positioning."

5. **"Prior authorization not obtained"** (NY Medicaid) - PA not submitted before service. Fix: For NY Medicaid, obtain prior authorization for power wheelchair accessories before dispensing. Verify PA requirements with payer.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific damage type** with detailed description
- Explain **why repair not feasible** (structural integrity, safety concerns)
- Document **medical necessity** for functional footrest system for proper lower extremity positioning
- Include **both KX and RB modifiers** for proper billing
- Note this is **replacement** on existing wheelchair (not bundled with new wheelchair)
- SWO required before dispensing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Obtain prior authorization** for power wheelchair accessory before dispensing
- Same detailed documentation as Medicare
- Fiscal order from physician required
- Document medical necessity for proper lower extremity positioning

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Damage description:** "Left/Right footrest upper hanger bracket [cracked/broken/worn/damaged] due to [structural failure/wear/impact]. Specific damage: [describe]. Functional impact: Cannot securely hold lower extension tube; footrest unstable; safety hazard."
- **Cannot repair:** "Upper hanger bracket cannot be repaired because [structural damage too severe/cracked bracket cannot be safely welded/worn clamping mechanism cannot be rebuilt/repair would compromise patient safety]. Replacement necessary."
- **Medical necessity:** "Patient requires proper lower extremity positioning with functional footrest system for wheelchair mobility and safe seating. Damaged bracket prevents proper footrest function. KX modifier: medical necessity requirements met."
