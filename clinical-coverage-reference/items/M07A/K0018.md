# K0018 - Detachable Adjustable Height Armrest Upper Portion

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Armrest Replacement Parts
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Upper portion only of detachable adjustable height armrest for replacement purposes. Top structural component that arm rests on. For use with existing K0017 (adjustable height armrest base). More economical than replacing complete armrest when base is functional.

## Component Relationship

### Complete Adjustable Height Armrest System

**K0017 (Base) - Complete armrest includes:**
- Base structure and mounting
- Height adjustment mechanism
- Detachment mechanism
- Upper armrest portion (included in K0017)

**K0018 (Upper Portion) - Replacement part includes:**
- Upper horizontal arm support structure
- Arm pad attachment area
- Connection to base portion
- Does NOT include base mechanism

### When to Use Each Code

**Use K0017 (Complete Armrest) when:**
- Initial armrest issue (new wheelchair or adding armrests)
- Entire armrest needs replacement (base damaged)
- Height adjustment mechanism not working
- Detachment mechanism broken
- Both base and upper portion damaged

**Use K0018 (Upper Portion Only) when:**
- Upper portion worn or damaged
- Base (K0017) still functional (height adjustment works, detachment works, base intact)
- More economical to replace upper portion only
- Patient already has K0017 base installed

## K0018 vs. K0019 (Arm Pad)

### K0018 (Upper Armrest Portion)
- **Component:** Structural upper armrest arm (support structure)
- **Size:** Larger component - horizontal arm support structure
- **Function:** Provides arm support structure
- **Includes:** Arm pad attachment area, connection to base

### K0019 (Arm Pad)
- **Component:** Cushioning pad only (comfort layer)
- **Size:** Smaller component - just padded surface
- **Function:** Provides cushioning/comfort on top of armrest
- **Attaches to:** Armrest structure (K0015, K0017, or K0020)

K0018 and K0019 are different components. Arm pad (K0019) attaches to armrest structure.

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient has existing K0017 (adjustable height armrest base)
2. K0017 base is functional (height adjustment works, detachment works)
3. Upper armrest portion worn or damaged requiring replacement
4. Upper portion not under manufacturer warranty
5. Reason for upper portion wear/damage

### Examples of Upper Portion Damage

**Wear and tear:**
- Upper arm support structure worn from repeated use
- Material fatigue from daily use
- Armrest arm cracked or fractured
- Connection points to base worn

**Damage:**
- Upper portion bent or deformed from impact
- Structural damage from fall or collision
- Arm pad attachment area damaged
- Connection mechanism to base broken

### Base Must Be Functional

Document that K0017 base is functional:
- Height adjustment mechanism works properly
- Detachment mechanism functions normally
- Base structure is intact (not damaged)
- No base-related problems

If base also damaged, must replace entire K0017 (not just K0018 upper portion).

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each upper portion
- Quantity 1 if only one armrest upper portion needs replacement
- Quantity 2 if both armrest upper portions need replacement

### Cost Comparison

**K0018 (upper portion only):** More economical when base functional
**K0017 (complete armrest):** Required when base also damaged

Choose K0018 when possible for cost-effectiveness.

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Requires K0017 base:** Cannot use K0018 without existing K0017 base
2. **Replacement only:** Not for initial issue - use K0017 for initial
3. **Base must be functional:** Document that height adjustment and detachment mechanisms work
4. **Cost-effective option:** Less expensive than K0017 when base doesn't need replacement
5. **RB modifier required:** Indicates replacement of part of DME
6. **Different from arm pad:** K0018 is structural; K0019 is cushioning pad
7. **Warranty verification:** Confirm upper portion not under manufacturer warranty

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair with detachable adjustable height armrests (K0017 bases installed [date]). [Left/right/both] armrest upper portion worn/damaged [describe specific wear/damage: cracked structure/worn connection points/material fatigue/impact damage/etc.]. Upper portion wear/damage affects [arm support function/safety/comfort]. K0017 base portion remains functional: height adjustment mechanism works properly, detachment mechanism functions normally, base structure intact. Upper portion not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Upper portion replacement (K0018) more economical than complete armrest replacement (K0017) since base functional. Recommend replacement of [left/right/both] detachable adjustable height armrest upper portion, quantity [1 or 2]."
