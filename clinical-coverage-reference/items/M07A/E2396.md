# E2396 - Caster Fork

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Caster Components
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Caster fork for power wheelchair replacement. Structural component that connects caster wheel to wheelchair frame and allows caster to swivel for steering. For front caster assemblies only.

## Caster Assembly Components

Power wheelchair front caster assembly consists of:

1. **Caster fork (E2396):** This code - mounting bracket that holds wheel and allows swivel
2. **Caster wheel rim/hub (E2395):** Wheel component that tire mounts on
3. **Caster tire (E2384, E2387, E2389, E2391, E2392):** Tire that mounts on wheel

Each component billed separately if damaged.

## Caster Fork Function

The caster fork:
- **Connects:** Attaches caster wheel to wheelchair frame
- **Swivels:** Allows caster to rotate on vertical axis for steering
- **Aligns:** Maintains proper caster angle and alignment
- **Supports:** Bears weight through caster to ground

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Caster fork damaged or worn beyond safe use
3. Fork not under manufacturer warranty
4. Specific fork damage (bent, cracked, worn swivel, etc.)
5. How damage affects function (alignment, swivel, steering, stability)

### Examples of Fork Damage

**Structural damage:**
- Bent fork arms (affects caster alignment)
- Cracked or fractured fork (structural integrity compromised)
- Fork deformation from impact (caster doesn't track properly)

**Functional damage:**
- Damaged swivel bearing (fork doesn't turn smoothly or at all)
- Worn swivel mechanism (excessive play, loose caster)
- Seized swivel bearing (caster won't turn for steering)
- Stripped mounting points (fork won't secure to wheelchair)

**Operational impact:**
- Wheelchair pulls to one side (misaligned fork)
- Difficulty steering (swivel binding)
- Excessive tire wear (improper alignment)
- Instability or wobbling (worn swivel bearing)

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each fork
- Quantity 1 if only one fork damaged
- Quantity 2 if both front forks need replacement
- Specify left/right or both

### Billing with Other Caster Components

**If only fork damaged:**
- Bill E2396 only (caster fork)

**If fork and wheel both damaged:**
- Bill E2396 (fork) AND E2395 (wheel)

**If fork, wheel, and tire all damaged:**
- Bill E2396 (fork) AND E2395 (wheel) AND appropriate tire code
- OR consider E2392 (integrated tire/wheel) if applicable instead of E2395 + tire

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** May require PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Front caster only:** This code for front caster forks; drive wheels don't have forks
2. **Swivel function:** Fork allows caster to swivel for steering - critical for wheelchair maneuverability
3. **Alignment critical:** Fork damage often causes alignment problems affecting wheelchair operation
4. **Separate billing:** Bill fork (E2396), wheel (E2395), and tire separately if multiple components damaged
5. **Impact damage:** Fork often damaged in impacts, falls, or collisions - document incident if applicable
6. **Warranty verification:** Confirm fork not under manufacturer warranty
7. **Replacement only:** Not included in initial wheelchair - for replacements only

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation]. [Left/right/both] front caster fork damaged [describe specific damage: bent fork arms/damaged swivel bearing/cracked fork/worn swivel mechanism/etc.]. Fork damage affects [caster alignment/swivel function/steering/wheelchair stability]. Functional impact: [wheelchair pulls to one side/difficulty steering/caster doesn't swivel properly/excessive tire wear/instability]. Fork damage compromises safe wheelchair operation. Fork not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Caster fork replacement medically necessary to restore proper caster function and safe wheelchair operation. Recommend replacement of caster fork, size [specify], quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both]."
