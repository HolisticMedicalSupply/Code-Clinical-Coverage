# K0053 - Elevating Footrests, Articulating (Telescoping)

## Clinical Overview

K0053 represents elevating footrests with articulating (telescoping) function for power wheelchairs. This code provides BOTH elevation AND telescoping (extend/retract) capability for multi-plane positioning. Requires meeting elevating legrest criteria PLUS justification for articulating feature.

**COVERAGE CRITERIA:** Must meet elevating legrest criteria (K0046) FIRST, THEN justify articulating function.

**Key Features:**
- Elevates (raises legrest for knee extension)
- Articulates/telescopes (extends/retracts for variable leg length positioning)
- Multi-plane adjustment for complex positioning needs
- Used with power recline/tilt systems
- Billed per EACH (not pair)

**Special Billing Note:** Can bill with Groups 1 & 2 PWCs at initial (exception to bundling rule for most codes).

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Covered:** Yes (when criteria met)

**COVERAGE CRITERIA - Two-Step Requirement:**

**Step 1: Must Meet Elevating Legrest Criteria (Same as K0046)**
- **Cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion** due to contractures or orthopedic conditions, OR
- **Significant edema** requiring elevation (venous insufficiency, lymphedema, CHF), OR
- **Has reclining back system** requiring coordinated legrest positioning

**Step 2: Justify Articulating Function Beyond Standard Elevation**
- Contractures requiring multi-plane adjustment (not just elevation)
- Variable leg length positioning needs
- Complex positioning with power recline/tilt systems
- Need for telescoping function for optimal positioning

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Meet elevating legrest criteria documentation** (Step 1)
- **Justification for articulating feature** (Step 2) - Why articulating needed beyond standard elevating legrest
- **Multi-plane adjustment needs documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **KX modifier** when criteria met

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** If with new power wheelchair *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** Bill per EACH (not pair) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **BUNDLED with:** E0990, E0995, K0042-K0047, E1009, E1010, E1012, K0195
- **EXCEPTION: Can bill with Groups 1 & 2 PWCs at initial** (different from most codes)
- UNIT: EACH (not pair) - If bilateral needed, bill 2 units
- PT/OT not required
- RESNA ATP not required

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Covered:** Yes (when criteria met)

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** required
- **Meet elevating legrest criteria** (same as Medicare Step 1)
- **Articulating function justification** (same as Medicare Step 2)
- **Medical necessity documentation** for both elevation AND articulating *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** Bill per EACH (not pair) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Same requirements as K0044 plus articulating justification
- Home assessment not required for accessory alone

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Elevating Legrest Criteria (Step 1 Requirement)

Must meet ONE of the following (same as K0046):

### 1. Cannot Achieve 90-Degree Knee Flexion
- Knee contractures preventing 90-degree flexion
- Orthopedic conditions limiting knee flexion
- Post-surgical knee conditions
- Arthritis limiting knee range of motion

**ICD-10 Examples:** M25.569 (knee pain), M24.569 (knee contracture)

### 2. Significant Edema Requiring Elevation
- Venous insufficiency (chronic venous disease)
- Lymphedema requiring leg elevation
- CHF with lower extremity edema
- Post-surgical edema requiring elevation

**ICD-10 Examples:** I87.2 (venous insufficiency), I89.0 (lymphedema), I50.9 (heart failure)

### 3. Has Reclining Back System
- Power recline system requiring coordinated legrest positioning
- Manual recline with elevating legrest coordination
- Tilt-in-space with elevating legrest for positioning

**Note:** If has reclining back, elevating legrest medically necessary for coordinated positioning *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Articulating (Telescoping) Justification (Step 2 Requirement)

After meeting elevating criteria, must justify articulating function:

### When is Articulating Needed Beyond Standard Elevation?

**Articulating Provides:**
- **Telescoping (extend/retract)** in addition to elevation
- **Variable leg length positioning** - Can adjust length for different leg positions
- **Multi-plane adjustment** - Not just up/down, but also forward/back positioning
- **Complex positioning coordination** with power recline/tilt systems

**Use K0053 (Articulating) When:**
- Contractures require multi-plane adjustment (not just elevation angle)
- Variable positioning needed throughout day (different leg lengths for different activities)
- Power recline/tilt system requires coordinated telescoping + elevation
- Standard elevating legrest (K0046) insufficient for positioning needs

**Use K0046 (Standard Elevating) When:**
- Only need elevation angle adjustment (up/down)
- No need for telescoping (extend/retract)
- Simple elevation adequate for edema management
- No complex multi-plane positioning needs

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0053 - Elevating footrests, articulating (telescoping), each"**
- [ ] **Quantity:** Number needed (typically 2 for bilateral)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (M25.569, I87.2, I89.0, etc.)
- [ ] **STEP 1: Document elevating legrest criteria (ONE required):**
  - [ ] Cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion (contractures, orthopedic conditions)
  - [ ] Significant edema requiring elevation (venous insufficiency, lymphedema, CHF)
  - [ ] Has reclining back system requiring coordinated positioning
- [ ] **STEP 2: Justify articulating function beyond standard elevation:**
  - [ ] Why articulating/telescoping needed vs. standard elevating legrest (K0046)
  - [ ] Multi-plane adjustment needs
  - [ ] Variable positioning requirements
  - [ ] Coordination with power recline/tilt if applicable
- [ ] KX modifier when criteria met
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document elevating legrest criteria (Step 1)
- [ ] Justify articulating feature (Step 2)
- [ ] Explain why standard elevating legrest (K0046) insufficient
- [ ] Document multi-plane adjustment needs

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Same as Medicare requirements
- [ ] Check if PA required

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Elevating legrest criteria not met"** - Missing Step 1 documentation. Fix: Must document ONE of three criteria: cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion OR significant edema requiring elevation OR has reclining back. Example: "Patient has venous insufficiency with chronic lower extremity edema requiring leg elevation. Significant edema present bilaterally. Elevation medically necessary for edema management." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Articulating function not justified"** - Missing Step 2 justification. Fix: Must explain why ARTICULATING (telescoping) needed beyond standard elevation. Example: "Patient requires articulating legrests for multi-plane positioning with power recline system. Standard elevating legrests (K0046) insufficient. Telescoping function needed to coordinate leg positioning during recline/tilt transitions. Variable leg length positioning required for optimal pressure relief." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Standard elevating legrest adequate (K0046)"** - Insufficient justification for articulating feature. Fix: Clearly differentiate articulating needs from standard elevation. Document why K0046 insufficient and K0053 medically necessary. Specify multi-plane adjustment needs, telescoping requirements, complex positioning coordination. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Billed with bundled code"** - Cannot bill separately when bundled. Fix: Verify not bundling with E0990, E0995, K0042-K0047, E1009, E1010, E1012, K0195. Exception: CAN bill with Groups 1 & 2 PWCs at initial. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Incorrect billing unit"** - Billed as pair instead of each. Fix: K0053 bills per EACH, not pair. If bilateral needed, bill 2 units (quantity 2), not 1 unit as pair. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document BOTH steps clearly** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Step 1: Elevating legrest criteria (one of three)
  - Step 2: Articulating justification (why telescoping needed)
- **Differentiate from K0046** - Explain why standard elevating insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Multi-plane positioning** - Use this term; emphasizes need beyond simple elevation *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Power recline/tilt coordination** - If applicable, document coordinated positioning needs *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- KX modifier when criteria met
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- Same documentation as Medicare
- Check if PA required - may need to submit for review *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order required
- Same requirements as K0044 plus articulating justification

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Step 1 (Elevating criteria):** "Patient has [specific condition: knee contractures/venous insufficiency/reclining back]. [Specific measurement or observation: cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion/bilateral lower extremity edema/power recline system]. Elevating legrest medically necessary for [specific reason]."
- **Step 2 (Articulating justification):** "Patient requires articulating (telescoping) legrests for multi-plane positioning. Standard elevating legrests (K0046) insufficient because [specific reason: contractures require variable leg length positioning/power recline system requires telescoping coordination/complex positioning needs]. Articulating function medically necessary for [specific outcome]."

## Comparison: K0053 vs. K0046

### K0053 (Elevating, Articulating/Telescoping)
- **Elevation:** YES (raises legrest)
- **Telescoping:** YES (extends/retracts)
- **Multi-plane:** YES (elevation + telescoping)
- **Criteria:** Elevating criteria PLUS articulating justification
- **Use when:** Need BOTH elevation AND telescoping
- **Billing:** Per EACH

### K0046 (Elevating, Non-Articulating)
- **Elevation:** YES (raises legrest)
- **Telescoping:** NO
- **Multi-plane:** NO (elevation only)
- **Criteria:** Elevating criteria only
- **Use when:** Need elevation only, no telescoping
- **Billing:** Per EACH

**Key Question:** Does patient need telescoping (extend/retract) in addition to elevation?
- **YES → K0053** (articulating)
- **NO → K0046** (standard elevating)
