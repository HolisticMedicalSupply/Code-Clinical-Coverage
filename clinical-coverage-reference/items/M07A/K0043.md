# K0043 - Footrest Lower Extension Tube (Replacement)

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Footrest Components - Replacement
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Lower extension tube for power wheelchair footrest replacement. Vertical tube component that connects footrest to wheelchair frame and allows height adjustment. RA modifier required. FOR REPLACEMENT ONLY - not billable at initial wheelchair issue.

## Footrest Component System

Power wheelchair footrest consists of:

### From Top to Bottom:
1. **K0044 - Upper hanger bracket:** Attaches to wheelchair frame, holds lower tube
2. **K0043 - Lower extension tube (this code):** Slides through bracket for height adjustment
3. **K0042 - Footplate:** Attaches to bottom of tube, supports foot

### Complete Assembly:
- **K0045 - Footrest complete assembly:** All components together (when multiple parts damaged)

## Lower Extension Tube Function

### What It Does:
- **Connects:** Footrest to wheelchair frame via upper bracket
- **Adjusts:** Slides up/down through bracket to adjust footrest height
- **Positions:** Maintains proper leg angle and footrest position
- **Secures:** Locks at desired height with securing mechanism

### Why Height Adjustment Matters:
- Proper knee angle (typically 90 degrees)
- Foot support without pressure on thighs
- Accommodation of varying leg lengths
- Optimal lower extremity positioning

## CRITICAL: Replacement Only

**K0043 is for REPLACEMENT ONLY:**
- Lower extension tubes INCLUDED with wheelchair at initial issue
- K0043 CANNOT be billed at initial wheelchair delivery
- Only billable as replacement when original tube damaged/worn
- Must be outside manufacturer warranty
- RA modifier required to indicate replacement

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document for Replacement
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Lower extension tube damaged, bent, or broken
3. Specific damage description
4. Damage cannot be repaired safely
5. Damage prevents proper footrest positioning
6. Tube outside manufacturer warranty

### Damage Documentation

Document specific damage:

**Bent Tube:**
- Tube bent from [impact/stress/improper handling]
- Bent tube prevents proper footrest height adjustment
- Cannot achieve correct leg positioning angle
- Repair would compromise structural integrity

**Broken Tube:**
- Tube cracked, fractured, or broken
- Structural failure creates safety hazard
- Footrest unstable with broken tube
- Cannot be safely repaired (welding inadequate for load-bearing)

**Worn Mechanism:**
- Sliding mechanism worn out
- Tube doesn't hold height position (slips down)
- Cannot maintain proper footrest height
- Height adjustment function lost

**Corrosion/Deterioration:**
- Metal tube corroded or rusted
- Material deterioration affecting structural integrity
- Corrosion from environmental exposure/moisture
- Compromised safety

**Why cannot repair:**
- Structural damage too severe for safe repair
- Bent tube cannot be straightened to original strength
- Broken tube cannot be safely welded for weight-bearing
- Repair would compromise patient safety

**How prevents proper positioning:**
- Cannot adjust footrest to correct height
- Improper leg angle from bent/damaged tube
- Footrest slips from worn mechanism
- Unstable positioning from broken tube

### Warranty Documentation

**CRITICAL:** Must document outside warranty
- Verify warranty end date
- If within warranty, pursue warranty claim with manufacturer
- If outside warranty, document warranty expiration date

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RA** (required) - Replacement of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each tube
- Order quantity based on need:
  - 1 tube (single footrest tube damaged)
  - 2 tubes (both footrest tubes damaged)

### Component vs. Complete Assembly

**K0043 (lower tube only):**
- Only lower extension tube damaged
- Upper bracket (K0044) and footplate (K0042) functional
- More economical than complete assembly

**K0045 (complete footrest assembly):**
- Multiple components damaged
- May be more efficient to replace entire assembly
- Consider when tube, bracket, and/or footplate all need replacement

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Check current codes; not required

## Special Considerations

1. **Replacement only:** Cannot bill at initial wheelchair issue - included in base wheelchair
2. **RA modifier required:** Indicates replacement of complete DME item
3. **Warranty critical:** Must be outside manufacturer warranty
4. **Cannot repair:** Must document repair not possible/safe
5. **Height adjustment function:** Emphasize impact on leg positioning
6. **Component-level replacement:** More economical than complete assembly if only tube damaged
7. **Typically pair:** Wheelchairs have 2 footrests - may need both tubes or just one
8. **Face-to-face not required:** For replacement accessory

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Lower extension tube damage:** [Left/Right/Both] footrest lower extension tube [damaged/bent/broken] requiring replacement. Specific damage: [bent tube from impact affecting height adjustment/cracked tube creating structural failure risk/worn sliding mechanism - tube doesn't hold height position/corroded tube compromising structural integrity].

**Cannot be repaired:** Lower extension tube cannot be repaired because [structural damage too severe for safe repair/bent tube cannot be straightened without compromising strength/broken tube cannot be safely welded for weight-bearing function/worn mechanism cannot be restored to proper function]. Replacement necessary.

**Functional impact:** Damaged lower extension tube prevents proper footrest positioning by [cannot adjust footrest to correct height for proper knee angle/bent tube causes improper leg positioning/footrest slips down from worn mechanism/unstable footrest from broken tube creates safety hazard]. Proper lower extremity positioning requires functional lower extension tube.

**Warranty status:** Lower extension tube outside manufacturer warranty. Wheelchair purchased [date]. Manufacturer warranty expired [date]. [Verify warranty documentation if available.]

**Other components:** [If only tube damaged:] Upper hanger bracket (K0044) and footplate (K0042) remain functional - tube-only replacement (K0043) appropriate. [If multiple components damaged:] Multiple footrest components damaged - consider complete footrest assembly (K0045) if more cost-effective.

Recommend footrest lower extension tube replacement (K0043), quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both], RA modifier for replacement."
