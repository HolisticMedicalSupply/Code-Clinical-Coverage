# K0043 - Footrest Lower Extension Tube (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

K0043 represents the lower extension tube component of power wheelchair footrest system for **REPLACEMENT ONLY**. This is the vertical tube component that connects footrest to wheelchair frame via upper hanger bracket and allows footrest height adjustment. Lower extension tubes are included with wheelchair at initial issue and **cannot be billed separately at initial delivery**. K0043 is only billable as replacement when original tube becomes damaged, bent, broken, or worn and is outside manufacturer warranty.

**Key Features:**
- Vertical tube connecting footrest to wheelchair frame
- Slides through upper hanger bracket (K0044) for height adjustment
- Allows proper leg positioning and knee angle
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - included at initial wheelchair issue

**REPLACEMENT ONLY:** Lower extension tube is BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue. K0043 cannot be billed when delivering new wheelchair - only as replacement when damaged and outside warranty.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Covered:** Yes (REPLACEMENT ONLY)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Detailed description of damage** to lower extension tube
- **Documentation that tube cannot be repaired** safely
- **Documentation of functional impact** - prevents proper footrest positioning
- **Warranty documentation** - must be outside manufacturer warranty
- **RA modifier required** for replacement billing

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for replacement accessory

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed when damaged and outside warranty *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** As needed per damaged tube (typically 1 or 2 depending on how many footrest tubes damaged) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - cannot bill at initial wheelchair delivery
- RA modifier required (Replacement of DME item)
- KU modifier NOT applicable per source documentation
- PT/OT evaluation not required for replacement
- RESNA ATP not required for replacement
- Must be outside manufacturer warranty to bill

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Covered:** Verify code availability with NYRx (518) 486-3209 *(Under Review)*

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** from physician required
- **Detailed damage description** required
- **Warranty status documentation** required
- **Check current codes** with NYRx before prescribing

**Prior Authorization:** Not required per source *(Under Review)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for replacement accessory

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as needed outside warranty *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** As needed per damaged tube *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Source indicates "Check current codes" - verify K0043 is in current fee schedule
- Same documentation requirements as Medicare

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County** - verify code availability with payer.

## Footrest Component System

### Component Hierarchy (Top to Bottom):
1. **K0044 - Upper hanger bracket:** Attaches to wheelchair frame, holds lower tube
2. **K0043 - Lower extension tube (this code):** Slides through bracket for height adjustment
3. **K0042 - Footplate:** Attaches to bottom of tube, supports foot

### Complete Assembly:
- **K0045 - Footrest complete assembly:** All components together (when multiple parts damaged)

### Lower Extension Tube Function

**What It Does:**
- Connects footrest to wheelchair frame via upper bracket
- Slides up/down through upper hanger bracket to adjust footrest height
- Maintains proper leg angle and footrest position
- Locks at desired height with securing mechanism

**Why Height Adjustment Matters:**
- Proper knee angle (typically 90 degrees)
- Foot support without pressure on thighs
- Accommodation of varying leg lengths
- Optimal lower extremity positioning for mobility and comfort

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0043 - Footrest, lower extension tube, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] **RA modifier** for replacement
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3, Z74.09)
- [ ] **Detailed description of tube damage:**
  - [ ] Type of damage: bent, broken, cracked, worn mechanism, corrosion
  - [ ] How damage occurred (if known)
  - [ ] Functional impact on footrest positioning
- [ ] **Documentation that tube cannot be repaired safely**
- [ ] **Documentation that damage prevents proper footrest positioning**
- [ ] **Warranty status - outside manufacturer warranty**
- [ ] **Quantity needed:** 1 or 2 tubes (specify which footrest: left/right/both)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document specific damage requiring replacement
- [ ] Explain why repair not possible or safe
- [ ] Document functional impact on footrest positioning
- [ ] Confirm outside manufacturer warranty

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Same documentation as Medicare
- [ ] Verify K0043 in current fee schedule with NYRx

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Covered under manufacturer warranty"** - Tube damage within warranty period. Fix: Verify warranty expiration date. If within warranty, pursue warranty claim with manufacturer. If outside warranty, document warranty end date clearly in prescription.

2. **"Billed at initial wheelchair delivery"** - Attempting to bill K0043 with new wheelchair. Fix: Do NOT bill K0043 at initial wheelchair issue - lower extension tube is BUNDLED with wheelchair base. Only bill K0043 as replacement on existing wheelchair.

3. **"Repair possible, replacement not medically necessary"** - Insufficient justification that tube cannot be repaired. Fix: Document specifically why repair is not possible or safe: "Bent tube cannot be straightened without compromising structural integrity" or "Broken tube cannot be safely welded for weight-bearing function" or "Worn sliding mechanism cannot be restored."

4. **"Insufficient documentation of damage"** - Vague damage description. Fix: Provide specific details: "Left footrest lower extension tube bent 15 degrees from impact when wheelchair struck doorframe. Bent tube prevents footrest from achieving proper height for 90-degree knee angle. Patient's knee forced into improper flexion angle causing discomfort."

5. **"Missing RA modifier"** - Billed without replacement modifier. Fix: Always include RA modifier when billing K0043 to indicate this is replacement of DME item, not initial issue.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific damage type** with detailed description
- Explain **why repair not feasible** (structural integrity, safety concerns)
- Document **functional impact** - how damage prevents proper footrest positioning
- Confirm **outside warranty** with warranty expiration date
- Include **RA modifier** for replacement billing
- SWO required before dispensing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Verify code availability** with NYRx (518) 486-3209 before prescribing
- Same detailed documentation as Medicare
- Fiscal order from physician required
- Document warranty status clearly

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Damage description:** "Left/Right footrest lower extension tube [bent/broken/cracked/worn] due to [impact/stress/wear/corrosion]. Specific damage: [describe]. Functional impact: Cannot adjust footrest to proper height for knee angle; causes improper leg positioning; footrest unstable."
- **Cannot repair:** "Lower extension tube cannot be repaired because [structural damage too severe/bent tube cannot be straightened without compromising strength/broken tube cannot be safely welded/worn mechanism cannot be restored]. Replacement necessary for safe footrest function."
- **Warranty status:** "Wheelchair purchased [date]. Manufacturer warranty expired [date]. Lower extension tube outside warranty period."
