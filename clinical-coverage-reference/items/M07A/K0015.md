# K0015 - Detachable Non-Adjustable Height Armrest

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Armrests - Detachable
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Detachable armrest for power wheelchair with fixed (non-adjustable) height. Armrest can be removed to facilitate side transfers. Standard armrest height. Most commonly included in initial wheelchair configuration.

## Armrest Type Comparison

### K0015 (Detachable, Non-Adjustable)
- **Detachable:** YES - can be removed for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** NO - fixed height
- **Use when:** Need armrest removal for transfers, standard height adequate

### K0017 (Detachable, Adjustable Height Base)
- **Detachable:** YES - can be removed for transfers
- **Height adjustable:** YES - multiple height positions
- **Use when:** Need armrest removal AND height adjustment

### K0020 (Fixed, Adjustable Height)
- **Detachable:** NO - cannot be removed
- **Height adjustable:** YES - multiple height positions
- **Use when:** Need height adjustment but NOT armrest removal

### Fixed Armrest (Included with Wheelchair)
- **Detachable:** NO - permanently attached
- **Height adjustable:** NO - fixed height
- **Use when:** No special armrest needs

## Detachable Armrest Function

Detachable armrests (K0015) facilitate:
- **Side transfers:** Sliding from wheelchair to bed, car, toilet, shower chair
- **Positioning:** Approaching tables, desks, counters more closely
- **Caregiving access:** Easier assistance with dressing, positioning
- **Medical procedures:** Access for blood pressure, IV placement on upper arm

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Medical necessity for detachable vs. fixed armrest
3. Transfer assessment showing need for armrest removal
4. Standard armrest height adequate (non-adjustable appropriate)
5. If replacement: documentation of need for replacement

### Transfer Assessment

Document transfer technique:
- **Type of transfer:** Side transfer, stand-pivot transfer, mechanical lift
- **Transfer frequency:** Multiple times daily, several times daily, occasional
- **Transfer destinations:** Bed, car, toilet, shower, furniture
- **Transfer assistance:** Independent, assisted, dependent
- **Barrier with fixed armrests:** Fixed armrest blocks transfer path, prevents close positioning

### Justification for K0015 (Non-Adjustable)

Document why non-adjustable height appropriate:
- Standard armrest height adequate for patient's arm length
- Patient does not need desk-height clearance
- No positioning needs requiring variable armrest height
- Non-adjustable armrest less expensive than adjustable (K0017)

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue or when not included
- **RB modifier** if billing as replacement of damaged/worn armrest

### Units
- Bill per each armrest
- Typically order pair: 2 units (left and right armrests)
- One pair per wheelchair

### When Separately Billable

**At initial issue:**
- When NOT included in wheelchair package (unusual - most include detachable armrests)

**As replacement:**
- Original armrests damaged or worn beyond use
- Reasonable replacement as needed
- RB modifier for replacement

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Usually included:** Most power wheelchairs include detachable armrests at initial issue
2. **Standard height only:** This code for non-adjustable height; use K0017 for height adjustment
3. **Pair recommended:** Typically order both armrests (2 units) for symmetry
4. **Arm pads separate:** K0019 (arm pad) is separate component, billed separately when worn
5. **Transfer-focused:** Primary justification is for facilitating transfers
6. **Face-to-face not required:** For accessory alone (if wheelchair already covered)
7. **Replacement coverage:** Covered as reasonable replacement when damaged/worn

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time]. Patient performs [independent/assisted] side transfers to/from wheelchair [frequency: multiple times daily] to [bed/car/toilet/etc.]. Transfer technique requires removal of armrests to [facilitate sliding transfer/allow close positioning/provide clear transfer path]. Fixed armrests would [block transfer path/prevent proper positioning/create transfer barrier]. Standard armrest height adequate for patient's [arm length/positioning needs] - height adjustability not required. [If at initial issue: Wheelchair configuration does not include detachable armrests.] [If replacement: Original armrests damaged/worn - reasonable replacement needed.] Detachable non-adjustable height armrests medically necessary to facilitate safe transfers and wheelchair function. Recommend detachable non-adjustable height armrests, quantity 2 (one pair - left and right)."
