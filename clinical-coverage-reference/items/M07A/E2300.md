## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not complex rehab power wheelchair"** - E2300 billed with Group 1/2 PWC or standard PWC. **AUTOMATIC DENIAL.** Fix: E2300 ONLY covered with Complex Rehab PWC codes K0835-K0864 OR K0890-K0891. If patient has Group 1/2 PWC (K0813-K0831), E2300 NOT covered - patient must qualify for complex rehab PWC first. Example: "Patient qualifies for Group 3 power wheelchair (K0841) due to SCI with limited UE function; power seat elevation (E2300) added to K0841 complex rehab PWC for transfers and reaching MRADLs; both K0841 and E2300 medically necessary."

2. **"MRADLs not specific enough"** - Vague MRADL descriptions like "reaching items" or "easier transfers." Fix: DETAILED, SPECIFIC descriptions required. Bad: "Power seat elevation for reaching." Good: "Patient with C6 SCI has limited reach range (can reach 42-48 inches from floor in standard seat height 19 inches); medications stored in bathroom cabinet at 60 inches, kitchen items at 54-62 inches; cannot reach these items from standard seat height; power seat elevation to 28 inches (9-inch elevation) enables reaching medications and food items at heights 50-62 inches; reaching medications and food preparation are essential MRADLs that cannot be performed without elevation."

3. **"Why alternatives inadequate not documented"** - Missing explanation why reachers, environmental modifications, or caregiver assistance not viable. Fix: Document why alternatives don't work: "Reachers considered but patient lacks grip strength to operate grabber; environmental modifications not feasible (rental apartment, landlord prohibits modifications, some items in public spaces); lives alone 8 hours daily when caregiver at work; requires independent access to medications, food; power seat elevation medically necessary for independent MRADLs when caregiver unavailable."

4. **"PT/OT has financial relationship to supplier"** - PT/OT works for or receives payment from DME supplier. **AUTOMATIC DENIAL.** Fix: PT/OT evaluation MUST be by clinician with NO financial relationship to supplier. Document: "PT evaluation performed by Jane Smith PT, DPT, employed by ABC Hospital Outpatient Therapy (independent facility, NO financial relationship to DME supplier); evaluation confirms MRADLs requiring power seat elevation; specialty PT assessment attached."

5. **"Face-to-face >6 months old"** - F2F examination more than 6 months before written order. Fix: F2F must be within 6 months before written order. If F2F too old, perform new F2F: "Face-to-face examination performed 4/15/2025; written order dated 6/10/2025 (within 6-month window); F2F documented MRADLs requiring elevation per NCD 280.16."

6. **"Missing WOPD elements"** - One or more of 7 WOPD elements missing. Fix: ALL 7 elements required. Common missing elements: (3) detailed MRADL description, (4) why cannot perform without elevation, (7) F2F date. Ensure all present: "WOPD contains all 7 required elements: (1) beneficiary name, (2) E2300 description, (3) detailed MRADLs [insert detailed descriptions], (4) why cannot perform without elevation [insert detailed explanations], (5) practitioner name/signature/date, (6) NPI, (7) F2F date 4/15/2025."

7. **"No RESNA ATP documentation"** - Missing RESNA ATP involvement. Fix: RESNA ATP REQUIRED. Document: "RESNA ATP assessment by John Doe, ATP (RESNA certification #12345); ATP evaluated patient and wheelchair needs; recommended power seat elevation for transfers and reaching MRADLs; ATP assessment and recommendations attached."

8. **"Convenience/leisure justification"** - Stated benefits are convenience or leisure, not medical necessity. Fix: Must demonstrate functional medical necessity for MRADLs: "Power seat elevation NOT for convenience or leisure. Elevation medically necessary to enable patient to perform essential MRADLs: (1) Transfers: level height with bed/toilet required for safe independent transfers without caregiver; (2) Medications: independent access to medications in cabinet at 60 inches height; patient lives alone daytime, requires independent medication access; these are essential MRADLs for independence and safety, not convenience."

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**

**MRADL Example 1 - Transfers:**
"Patient with T4 complete SCI; performs independent slide board transfers from power wheelchair to bed, toilet, car; current wheelchair seat height 19 inches; bed height 26 inches, toilet 17 inches, car seat 21 inches; patient can only transfer independently when seat heights within 2 inches of each other (biomechanical limitation from trunk control deficit); cannot safely transfer with >2-inch height difference (risk of fall, skin shear); environmental modifications not feasible (rental apartment, public bathrooms, multiple vehicles); caregiver assistance not always available (patient works, lives alone 8+ hours daily); power seat elevation from 19 inches to 17-26 inches (7-inch elevation range) medically necessary to achieve level seat height for safe independent transfers to multiple surfaces; transfers are essential MRADL that cannot be performed independently without elevation"

**MRADL Example 2 - Reaching:**
"Patient with C6 SCI; limited UE function and reach range; from standard seat height 19 inches, patient can reach heights 42-50 inches; medications stored in bathroom cabinet 60 inches, kitchen items 54-62 inches, light switches 48 inches, thermostat 54 inches; cannot reach medications or food items from standard seat height; attempted solutions: (1) reachers - patient lacks grip strength and dexterity to operate reaching device, (2) lowering storage - rental apartment, landlord prohibits modifications, many items in shared/public spaces, (3) caregiver assistance - patient lives alone 10 hours daily when caregiver at work; power seat elevation to 28 inches (9-inch elevation) enables reaching heights 51-63 inches; enables independent access to medications (critical for health management), food preparation (nutrition), environmental controls (comfort/safety); reaching activities are essential MRADLs that cannot be performed independently without elevation"

**MRADL Example 3 - Work:**
"Patient with muscular dystrophy; uses power wheelchair; employed as graphic designer working at computer desk; standard desk height 29 inches; from wheelchair seat height 19 inches, patient's eye level 47 inches, elbow height 28 inches; this position creates severe neck flexion (head tilted down 35 degrees to view monitor at 42 inches), shoulder elevation (elbows 1 inch below desk creating shoulder hiking), resulting in neck pain, headaches, shoulder pain limiting work to 2-3 hours before pain severe; ergonomic assessment shows optimal positioning: eye level 52 inches (monitor at 48 inches, 4 inches below eyes), elbow level 29 inches (level with desk); power seat elevation to 24 inches (5-inch elevation) achieves eye level 52 inches, elbow 29 inches, enabling neutral neck and shoulder positioning; alternatives considered: (1) desk lowering - shared office space, not feasible, (2) standing desk - patient cannot stand, (3) alternate work - patient's job requires computer desk work; power seat elevation medically necessary to enable patient to work without pain at computer desk meeting ergonomic requirements; work is essential MRADL for livelihood that cannot be performed without elevation"

**PT/OT Specialty Evaluation Example:**
"PT specialty evaluation performed 4/15/2025 by Jane Smith, PT, DPT, specialist in spinal cord injury rehabilitation, employed by ABC Hospital Rehabilitation Department (independent facility with NO financial relationship to DME supplier XYZ Company). Assessment: Patient with C6 SCI evaluated for power wheelchair seating and mobility needs. Patient demonstrates limited UE function (C6 level), limited reach range, requires power wheelchair with complex controls. MRADLs requiring power seat elevation identified: (1) Transfers: slide board transfers require level seat heights; current static seat height inadequate for multiple transfer surfaces; elevation 17-26 inches needed. (2) Reaching: medications, food at 54-62 inches height; cannot reach from 19-inch seat height; elevation to 28 inches needed for reaching heights 51-63 inches. Patient trialed power seat elevation during assessment; successfully transferred to bed at matching heights; successfully reached items at 60 inches with elevated seat; unable to perform these MRADLs from standard height. Recommendation: Power seat elevation system (E2300) on Group 3 complex rehab power wheelchair medically necessary for independent transfers and reaching MRADLs. Elevation range 17-28 inches (9-inch elevation) needed. PT specialty evaluation confirms medical necessity for E2300 per NCD 280.16."

**RESNA ATP Documentation Example:**
"RESNA ATP assessment performed 4/20/2025 by John Doe, ATP, RESNA certification #12345. ATP evaluated patient's wheelchair and seating needs including power seat elevation requirements. Assessment confirms: (1) Patient requires complex rehab power wheelchair (Group 3, K0841) due to complex seating and control needs from C6 SCI. (2) Power seat elevation medically necessary for MRADLs: transfers requiring level heights with multiple surfaces, reaching activities for medications and food. (3) Elevation range 17-28 inches (9-inch elevation) recommended based on transfer surface heights and reaching heights measured. (4) Patient successfully demonstrated transfer and reaching with elevation during trial. ATP recommendation: E2300 power seat elevation system on K0841 Group 3 PWC medically necessary per NCD 280.16 coverage criteria for MRADLs that cannot be performed without elevation."
