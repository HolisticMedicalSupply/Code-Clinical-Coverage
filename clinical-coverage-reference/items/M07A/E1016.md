# E1016 - Shock Absorber (Manual Wheelchair)

## Clinical Overview

E1016 represents shock absorbers for manual wheelchairs providing vibration dampening for patients with pain conditions or spinal precautions who use wheelchairs extensively on rough terrain. NOT for comfort/convenience - requires medical necessity.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare: Covered with SWO, no PA. PT/OT recommended. NOT typically included; bill separately when medically necessary. Usually need 2 (bill per each).

### Medicaid: May require PA. PT/OT recommended. Document terrain/environment use. Medical necessity for vibration dampening.

## Key Requirements

**Medical Necessity:** Pain condition or spinal precautions worsened by vibration
**Environment:** Extensive outdoor use on rough/uneven terrain
**Documentation:** Pain/spinal condition, environment of use, why shock absorption medically necessary
**Quantity:** Usually 2 needed (one front, one rear or pair)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Comfort/convenience item"** - Fix: Document medical condition (spinal instability, post-surgical precautions, chronic pain) exacerbated by vibration.
2. **"Indoor use only"** - Fix: Document extensive outdoor wheelchair use on rough terrain (gravel, uneven sidewalks, grass). Indoor use doesn't require shock absorbers.
