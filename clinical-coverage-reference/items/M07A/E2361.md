# E2361 - Group 24 Sealed Lead Acid Battery

## Clinical Overview

E2361 represents Group 24 sealed lead acid batteries for power wheelchairs. Group 24 is a SMALLER battery size than Group 27, used in power wheelchairs requiring smaller battery footprint. Same coverage requirements as E2359 (Group 27 sealed) - only difference is battery size.

**CRITICAL:** **ONLY SEALED batteries covered.** Non-sealed batteries (E2362) are DENIED per LCD L33792.

**Key Features:**
- Group 24 battery size (smaller than Group 27)
- Physical dimensions: approx. 10.2" L x 6.8" W x 8.9" H
- Typical capacity: 70-85 Ah
- SEALED lead acid type: gel cell OR absorbed glass mat (AGM)
- Maintenance-free
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time per LCD L33792

## Coverage Details

**Same coverage as E2359 (Group 27 sealed) - all requirements identical except battery size.**

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (sealed batteries only)

**All requirements same as E2359:**
- SWO required
- NO PA
- NO face-to-face required for battery replacement
- Documentation power wheelchair meets coverage criteria
- Proof outside warranty
- Battery specifications (Group 24 sealed)
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time per LCD L33792

### NY Medicaid

**Covered:** Yes (sealed batteries only)

**All requirements same as E2359:**
- Fiscal order
- Documentation wheelchair meets WME criteria
- Proof outside warranty
- May require PA depending on frequency

## Prescription Checklist

**Same as E2359 except:**
- [ ] Specify battery size: **Group 24** (not Group 27)
- [ ] Verify wheelchair uses Group 24 size (check wheelchair manual/specification)

**All other requirements identical to E2359.**

## Common Denial Reasons

**Same as E2359 plus:**

**"Wrong battery size"** - Group 24 ordered but wheelchair requires Group 27 (or vice versa). Fix: Match battery size to wheelchair specification. Check wheelchair manual or manufacturer specification: "Patient's power wheelchair (K0822) requires Group 24 batteries per manufacturer specification; ordering 2 units E2361 (Group 24 sealed, gel cell type) matching wheelchair battery compartment size."

## Tips for Approval

**Same as E2359 - all tips identical.**

Key points:
- Document wheelchair outside warranty
- ONLY sealed batteries (gel cell or absorbed glass mat)
- Up to 2 batteries maximum
- Battery wear/diminished capacity documented
- **Verify correct battery size** (Group 24 for this code)

## Related Codes

- **E2361** - Group 24 sealed (this code - smaller size)
- **E2363** - Group 22NF sealed
- **E2365** - U-1 sealed (compact)
- **E2371** - Group 24 sealed deep cycle

**NOT COVERED - Non-Sealed (DO NOT USE):**
- **E2362** - Group 24 non-sealed - **DENIED**

**Charger:**
- **E2366** - Single mode battery charger (for sealed batteries)

## Battery Size Comparison

**Group 24** (E2361) - This code:
- Smaller than Group 27
- Physical dimensions: approx. 10.2" L x 6.8" W x 8.9" H
- Typical capacity: 70-85 Ah
- Used in power wheelchairs with smaller battery compartments

**Group 27** (E2359):
- Larger than Group 24
- Physical dimensions: approx. 12.0" L x 6.8" W x 8.9" H
- Typical capacity: 75-100 Ah
- More common size for standard power wheelchairs

**Check wheelchair specification** to determine correct battery size. Group 24 and Group 27 NOT interchangeable - different physical dimensions.
