# E0973 - Adjustable Height Detachable Armrest

## Clinical Overview

E0973 represents an adjustable height detachable armrest providing variable arm support that can be adjusted throughout the day. Unlike fixed armrests, this accessory allows height adjustment for transfers, positioning, desk clearance, pressure relief, or accommodation of varying activity needs. The detachable feature facilitates side transfers.

**Key Features:**
- Adjustable height mechanism (user/caregiver can adjust)
- Detachable for transfers
- Complete assembly including hardware
- Billed per each armrest (typically order pair)
- Optimizes shoulder/elbow positioning

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- SCI patient requiring varied armrest heights: lower for transfers, higher for pressure relief
- Hemiplegia patient needing adjustable height for affected arm support
- Patient with joint pain requiring position changes throughout day
- Wheelchair user needing desk clearance at work (lower armrests) but higher armrests for positioning at home

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Medical necessity** for height adjustment documented
- **Functional need** for adjustability (vs. fixed armrests)
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** (not required) for positioning assessment

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One pair (2 armrests) per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **Included in some wheelchair packages** at initial issue
- **May be separately billable** with complex rehab power wheelchairs
- PT/OT not required but recommended for positioning justification
- RESNA ATP not required
- KU modifier may apply with certain complex rehab codes *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** required
- **Justification for adjustable vs. fixed height** armrests
- **Measurement documentation** (arm length, shoulder height, functional positioning needs)
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** for positioning assessment

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA *(Under Review)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One pair (2 armrests) per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**

- PT/OT evaluation recommended (helps justify adjustability need)
- May require PA depending on cost - check with DVS/eMedNY

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0973 - Adjustable height detachable armrest, each"**
- [ ] **Quantity: 2 (one pair) typically**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (wheelchair dependence, hemiplegia, joint pain, SCI)
- [ ] **Document functional need for adjustable height:**
  - [ ] Transfers requiring lower armrest position
  - [ ] Pressure relief requiring higher armrest position
  - [ ] Desk clearance needs (work, school, dining)
  - [ ] Varying positioning needs throughout day
  - [ ] Upper extremity length accommodation
- [ ] **Justification for adjustable vs. fixed height:**
  - [ ] Why fixed height armrests inadequate
  - [ ] Specific activities requiring height adjustment
  - [ ] Frequency of adjustment needed
- [ ] **PT/OT evaluation recommended** (positioning assessment, measurements)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document functional need for height adjustment
- [ ] Medical necessity for adjustability vs. fixed armrests
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended for positioning justification

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Justification for adjustable vs. fixed height
- [ ] Measurement documentation
- [ ] PT/OT evaluation recommended
- [ ] May need PA - check with DVS/eMedNY

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Fixed armrests adequate"** - Insufficient justification for adjustability. Fix: Document specific functional needs requiring height adjustment: "Patient with T10 SCI requires lower armrest height (8 inches) for slide board transfers but higher height (11 inches) for pressure relief and positioning during day; fixed armrests at single height cannot accommodate both needs."

2. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Vague justification for adjustability. Fix: Provide specific examples of activities requiring different armrest heights with measurements. Link to diagnosis and functional limitations.

3. **"No PT/OT evaluation"** (especially Medicaid) - Missing positioning assessment. Fix: While not required for Medicare, PT/OT evaluation significantly strengthens justification. Should document: current armrest height inadequate for multiple activities, measurements for optimal heights for different activities, trial of adjustable armrests successful.

4. **"Convenience item"** - Perceived as convenience rather than medical necessity. Fix: Link adjustability need to medical diagnosis and functional impairment. Example: "Patient with hemiplegia requires higher armrest on affected side for arm support but must lower armrest for assisted transfers; adjustable armrests allow optimization for both medical needs."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific functional needs** for height adjustment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **why fixed armrests cannot meet needs** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** - strengthens justification *(Under Review)*
- Include **measurements** for optimal heights for different activities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May be included in complex rehab wheelchair packages

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Justification for adjustable vs. fixed** height critical *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **PT/OT evaluation recommended** for positioning assessment *(Under Review)*
- **Measurement documentation** supports medical necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May require PA - check first

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Transfer need**: "Patient with SCI performs independent slide board transfers requiring armrest height 8 inches for board placement; standard 10-inch fixed armrests obstruct transfer and cause shoulder strain"
- **Pressure relief**: "Patient requires armrest height 11 inches for weight shifting and pressure relief (push-ups); same patient needs 8-inch height for transfers; adjustable armrests accommodate both medical needs"
- **Activity variation**: "Patient attends college and requires lower armrests (7 inches) for desk clearance in classrooms; requires higher armrests (10 inches) for upper extremity support during community mobility; adjustable armrests optimize positioning for both essential activities"
- **PT/OT assessment**: "PT evaluation 10/25/2025: Optimal armrest height for transfers 8 inches; optimal height for pressure relief 11 inches; optimal height for desk work 7 inches; patient requires adjustable armrests to accommodate functional positioning needs throughout day; trial of adjustable armrests successful"

## Related Codes

- **E0973** - Adjustable height detachable armrest (this code)
- **K0015** - Detachable non-adjustable height armrest - fixed height, detachable
- **K0017** - Detachable adjustable armrest base - replacement part
- **K0018** - Detachable adjustable armrest upper portion - replacement part
- **K0019** - Arm pad replacement - padding only
- **K0020** - Fixed adjustable height armrest, pair - fixed position (not user-adjustable)

**Note:** E0973 is USER-ADJUSTABLE (can be adjusted by patient/caregiver throughout day). K0020 is FIXED adjustable (set at one height during fitting, not regularly adjusted). Different clinical applications and medical necessity criteria.
