# E2375 - Non-Expandable Controller (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E2375 represents non-expandable controllers for power wheelchairs. Controller is electronics system allowing patient to operate wheelchair via joystick or other input. "Non-expandable" means controller cannot add additional control functions. For REPLACEMENT only when controller fails.

**Key Features:**
- Non-expandable (standard controller)
- Cannot add additional control functions
- Replacement only
- Includes all related electronics and mounting hardware
- RB modifier required
- Must be outside warranty period

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** for controller replacement
- **Documentation of controller failure**
- **Proof NOT covered under warranty**
- **Explanation why non-expandable vs. expandable** (E2376, E2377, E2378)

**Prior Authorization:** NO PA
**Face-to-Face:** Not required *(Under Review)*
**PT/OT/RESNA ATP:** Not required
**Modifiers:** **RB modifier REQUIRED** for replacement
**Frequency:** Replacement when failed and not under warranty *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
**Quantity:** One per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- For REPLACEMENT only
- Typically included with wheelchair at initial issue
- Must explain why non-expandable appropriate
- KU modifier NOT applicable

### NY Medicaid

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** specifying controller replacement
- **Documentation of failure**
- **Warranty status**
- **Cost estimate**

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA depending on cost *(Under Review)*
**Face-to-Face:** Not required *(Under Review)*
**Frequency:** Replacement as needed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
**Quantity:** One per wheelchair *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E2375 - Non-expandable controller"**
- [ ] **Modifier: RB (replacement part)**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 wheelchair dependence)
- [ ] **Controller failure documentation:**
  - [ ] Controller malfunction description
  - [ ] How failure affects wheelchair operation
  - [ ] When failure occurred
- [ ] **Why non-expandable vs. expandable:**
  - [ ] Patient doesn't need power seating or environmental controls
  - [ ] Standard controller functions adequate
  - [ ] No anticipated need for expansion
- [ ] **Warranty status:** Wheelchair age, proof outside warranty
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Written order for controller replacement
- [ ] Documentation of controller failure
- [ ] Proof not covered under warranty
- [ ] Explanation why non-expandable
- [ ] RB modifier

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Documentation of failure
- [ ] Warranty status
- [ ] Cost estimate
- [ ] May need PA if high cost

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Under warranty"** - Fix: "Wheelchair purchased 3 years ago; warranty expired; controller failed outside warranty; E2375 replacement not covered under warranty."

2. **"Expandable controller more appropriate"** - Fix: "Patient requires only standard wheelchair control functions (forward, reverse, turning); no power seating system; no environmental controls; no anticipated need for additional control functions; non-expandable controller (E2375) appropriate for patient's needs; expandable controller unnecessary."

3. **"No RB modifier"** - Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier for replacement parts.

4. **"Controller failure not documented"** - Fix: "Power wheelchair controller stopped functioning; joystick input does not control wheelchair; electronics malfunction confirmed; wheelchair inoperable; controller replacement medically necessary for wheelchair function."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document controller failure** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Proof outside warranty** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **RB modifier REQUIRED** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Explain why non-expandable adequate** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Documentation of failure** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Warranty status** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Cost estimate** required
- **May require PA** if high cost

## Related Codes

- **E2375** - Non-expandable controller (this code - standard)
- **E2376** - Expandable controller (can add functions)
- **E2377** - Expandable controller (more functions)
- **E2378** - Actuator replacement (different component)

## Non-Expandable vs Expandable Controllers

**E2375 - Non-Expandable (this code):**
- Standard controller
- Cannot add additional functions
- Appropriate when: no power seating, no environmental controls, standard wheelchair use

**E2376/E2377 - Expandable:**
- Can add control functions
- Appropriate when: power seating system, environmental controls, or anticipated future needs

**Document why non-expandable adequate for patient's needs.**
