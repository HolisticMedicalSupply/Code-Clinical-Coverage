# E2367 - Dual Mode Battery Charger (NOT COVERED AS REPLACEMENT)

## ⚠️ COVERAGE ALERT: NOT COVERED AS REPLACEMENT ⚠️

**E2367 is DENIED for replacements by Medicare per LCD L33792.**

Dual mode chargers are DENIED as not reasonable and necessary when provided as replacement.

## Use This Code Instead (COVERED):

**For battery charger replacement:**
- **E2366** - Single mode battery charger - **USE THIS CODE**

## Why E2367 Is NOT Covered

**Policy:** LCD L33792 denies dual mode chargers for replacements as not medically necessary.

**Rationale:**
- Only SEALED batteries covered (non-sealed batteries DENIED)
- Dual mode charger charges EITHER sealed OR non-sealed batteries
- Since only sealed batteries covered, dual mode functionality unnecessary
- Single mode charger (E2366) adequate for sealed batteries

## What To Do

**If you need battery charger replacement:**

1. **Order E2366** (single mode charger) instead of E2367
2. Specify charger for sealed lead acid batteries
3. E2366 adequate since only sealed batteries covered

**Billing:**
- ❌ DO NOT bill E2367 (dual mode) - claim will be DENIED
- ✅ Bill E2366 (single mode) - covered

## Related Codes

- **E2367** - Dual mode battery charger (this code - DENIED for replacements)
- **E2366** - Single mode battery charger (USE THIS)

**Batteries (all sealed):**
- E2359, E2361, E2363, E2365, E2371, K0733
