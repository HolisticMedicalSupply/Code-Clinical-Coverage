# E0982 - Back Upholstery (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E0982 represents replacement back upholstery for wheelchairs when the original upholstery is damaged, torn, or soiled beyond cleaning. Coverage criteria are identical to E0981 (seat upholstery), but E0982 applies specifically to the BACK upholstery component.

**Key Features:**

- For damaged, torn, or soiled upholstery beyond cleaning
- Must be outside warranty coverage
- Same coverage criteria as E0981 (seat upholstery)

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0982 - Back upholstery, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] **RB modifier** (replacement - REQUIRED for Medicare)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 wheelchair dependence, Z74.09 reduced mobility)
- [ ] **Documentation of damage:**
  - [ ] Back upholstery torn/ripped (describe location and extent)
  - [ ] Back upholstery soiled beyond cleaning (describe condition)
  - [ ] Back upholstery worn and no longer provides adequate support
  - [ ] Cannot be repaired
- [ ] **Warranty status:**

- [ ] **Replacement necessity:**
  - [ ] Replacement necessary for continued safe wheelchair use
  - [ ] Current back upholstery cannot be repaired or cleaned
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO with RB modifier):**
- [ ] Written order for back upholstery replacement
- [ ] Documentation of damage
- [ ] Proof not covered under warranty
- [ ] RB modifier on claim

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify "back upholstery replacement"
- [ ] Description of damage
- [ ] Warranty status documentation

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Within warranty period"** - Upholstery covered by manufacturer warranty. Fix: Verify warranty status. If within warranty, contact manufacturer for warranty replacement. Only bill E0982 if warranty expired or damage not covered under warranty terms.

2. **"Missing RB modifier"** (Medicare) - Replacement billing without RB modifier. Fix: RB modifier REQUIRED for replacement billing.

3. **"Insufficient documentation of damage"** - Vague description of condition. Fix: Provide specific documentation: "Back upholstery torn in 2 locations (8-inch tear upper back, 5-inch tear mid-back left); foam exposed; cannot be repaired; replacement necessary; warranty expired 03/20/2023."

4. **"Confusion with E0981"** - Wrong code billed. Fix: E0981 is SEAT upholstery. E0982 is BACK upholstery. Use correct code. If both seat AND back need replacement, bill BOTH codes separately (E0981 and E0982).

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **RB modifier MANDATORY** for replacement billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Verify warranty status** - must be expired or damage not covered *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **specific damage** to BACK upholstery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Same criteria as E0981, applied to back component

**NY Medicaid:**
- Clearly state "**back upholstery replacement**" in fiscal order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Description of damage** with specifics *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Warranty status documentation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Generally no PA needed for routine upholstery replacement

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Damage documentation**: "Back upholstery severely torn with 8-inch vertical tear upper back and 5-inch tear mid-back left side; foam padding exposed; tears cannot be repaired; upholstery worn beyond useful life; replacement necessary for continued safe wheelchair use; original wheelchair delivered 04/10/2019, 5-year warranty expired 04/10/2024"
- **Soiling documentation**: "Back upholstery soiled beyond cleaning; professional cleaning attempted without success; replacement necessary for hygiene; warranty expired"
- **Multiple components**: "Both seat AND back upholstery require replacement due to extensive wear and tears; ordering E0981 (seat) and E0982 (back) separately; warranty expired 2 years ago"

## Related Codes

- **E0982** - Back upholstery replacement (this code)
- **E0981** - Seat upholstery replacement - for seat upholstery (separate from back)
- **K0108** - Wheelchair component/accessory NOS - for unlisted wheelchair components

**Note:** E0981 is SEAT upholstery. E0982 is BACK upholstery. Separate components. If BOTH seat and back need replacement, bill BOTH codes separately (E0981 + E0982). Both require RB modifier.

## Seat vs Back Upholstery

**E0981 (Seat):**
- Seat cushion/upholstery component
- Where patient sits
- Bears weight during sitting

**E0982 (Back):**
- Back rest upholstery component
- Provides back support
- Separate from seat

**If both need replacement:** Bill both E0981 AND E0982 with RB modifiers

## Warranty Considerations

**Same as E0981 - Check warranty status before billing:**
- Standard wheelchair warranties: typically 1-5 years
- Damage covered under warranty: manufacturer responsible
- Normal wear beyond warranty period: payer covers replacement

**Only bill payer when:**
- Warranty expired
- OR damage not covered under warranty terms

**If within warranty:** Contact wheelchair manufacturer for warranty replacement.
