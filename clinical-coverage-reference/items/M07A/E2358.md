# E2358 - Group 27 Non-Sealed Lead Acid Battery (NOT COVERED)

## ⚠️ COVERAGE ALERT: NOT COVERED ⚠️

**E2358 is NOT COVERED by Medicare or Medicaid.**

Non-sealed lead acid batteries are **DENIED** as not reasonable and necessary per **Medicare LCD L33792**.

## Use These Codes Instead (COVERED):

**For Group 27 battery size:**
- **E2359** - Group 27 **SEALED** lead acid battery (gel cell, absorbed glass mat) - **USE THIS CODE**

**For other battery sizes (all SEALED):**
- **E2361** - Group 24 sealed battery
- **E2363** - Group 22NF sealed battery
- **E2365** - U-1 sealed battery
- **E2371** - Group 24 sealed deep cycle battery
- **K0733** - Group 34 sealed battery

## Why E2358 Is NOT Covered

**Policy:** Medicare LCD L33792 denies non-sealed lead acid batteries as not reasonable and necessary.

**Rationale:**
- Non-sealed batteries (wet cell) require regular maintenance
- Risk of acid leakage and spills
- Safety hazards for users with limited mobility/dexterity
- Sealed batteries (gel cell, absorbed glass mat) provide same function without maintenance/safety issues
- Sealed batteries are safer, maintenance-free alternative

## What To Do

**If you need Group 27 battery for power wheelchair:**

1. **Order E2359** (Group 27 SEALED battery) instead of E2358
2. Specify battery type: gel cell or absorbed glass mat (both are sealed types)
3. Document power wheelchair requires Group 27 sealed battery replacement
4. Ensure battery outside warranty period
5. Up to 2 batteries covered at any one time per LCD L33792

**Billing:**
- ❌ DO NOT bill E2358 (non-sealed) - claim will be DENIED
- ✅ Bill E2359 (sealed) - covered when medically necessary

## Related Codes

**NOT COVERED (Non-Sealed Batteries - DO NOT USE):**

- **E2360** - Group 27 non-sealed wet cell (DENIED)
- **E2362** - Group 24 non-sealed (DENIED)
- **E2364** - Group 22NF non-sealed (DENIED)

- **E2363** - Group 22NF sealed
- **E2365** - U-1 sealed
- **E2371** - Group 24 sealed deep cycle
- **K0733** - Group 34 sealed
