# K0047 - Elevating Legrest Upper Hanger Bracket (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

K0047 represents the upper hanger bracket component of power wheelchair **ELEVATING LEGREST** system for **REPLACEMENT ONLY**. This is the top mounting component that attaches to wheelchair frame and holds the elevating legrest lower extension tube. **All requirements IDENTICAL to K0046** per source documentation.

**CRITICAL: K0047 is for ELEVATING legrests, NOT standard footrests** (standard footrest bracket is K0044). Patient must meet elevating legrest medical necessity criteria before billing K0047.

Elevating legrest upper hanger brackets are BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue with K0044, wheelchair bases, and elevating legrests and **cannot be billed separately at initial delivery**. K0047 is only billable as replacement when original bracket becomes damaged and patient continues to meet elevating legrest criteria.

**Key Features:**
- Upper hanger bracket for ELEVATING legrest (not standard footrest)
- Attaches to wheelchair frame, holds elevating legrest lower tube
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - BUNDLED at initial with elevating legrests
- All requirements IDENTICAL to K0046

**CRITICAL - Elevating Legrest Criteria (Same as K0046):** Patient must meet ONE of these criteria:
1. **Cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion** (knee contracture, limited ROM)
2. **Significant lower extremity edema** (venous insufficiency, lymphedema, CHF)
3. **Has reclining back** (positioning with recline requires leg elevation)

**Cannot bill K0047 without documenting elevating legrest medical necessity.**

## Elevating Legrest Component System

### Elevating Legrest Components (Top to Bottom):
1. **K0047 - Upper hanger bracket (this code):** Attaches to wheelchair frame, holds lower tube
