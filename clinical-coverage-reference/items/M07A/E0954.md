# E0954 - Foot Box (Per Foot)

## Clinical Overview

E0954 represents a foot box accessory providing enclosure and containment for the foot. Unlike standard open footrests, a foot box encloses the foot/ankle area and is used for severe lower extremity edema requiring elevation and containment, open foot wounds requiring protection, severe spasticity with foot positioning issues, or environmental protection needs.

**Key Features:**
- Enclosed container for foot/ankle
- Provides elevation and containment
- Protects feet from environmental hazards
- Includes attachment and mounting hardware
- Billed per each foot (one or two as needed)

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- CHF patient with severe bilateral lower extremity edema requiring containment
- Diabetic patient with foot ulcer requiring wound protection during wheelchair mobility
- Lymphedema patient requiring elevated positioning with support
- SCI patient with severe foot spasticity needing containment

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Standard Written Order (SWO)** required
- **Medical documentation** of edema, wounds, or positioning need
- **Specific medical necessity** for foot box vs. standard footrests

**Prior Authorization:** NOT required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement as medically necessary *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One per wheelchair as medically necessary; bill per foot *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- **NOT separately billable** at initial wheelchair issue
- **Separately billable only** as replacement or addition after wheelchair delivered
- Can order one foot box (unilateral) or two (bilateral) depending on need
- PT/OT not required; RESNA ATP not required
- KU modifier NOT applicable

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Covered:** Yes

**Requirements:**
- **Fiscal order** required
- **Document medical need** (edema, wounds, environmental protection)
- **Clinical notes** supporting need for foot box

**Prior Authorization:** May require PA *(Under Review)*

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for accessory alone *(Under Review)*

**Frequency:** Reasonable replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Quantity:** One per wheelchair as needed; bill per foot *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Home assessment not required for foot box alone
- May require PA depending on cost - check with DVS/eMedNY
- Document specific medical indication (edema, wound protection, etc.)

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0954 - Foot box, any type, each foot"**
- [ ] **Quantity: Specify one (unilateral) or two (bilateral) foot boxes**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (edema, lymphedema, diabetic foot ulcer, venous insufficiency, SCI)
- [ ] **Document medical need for foot box:**
  - [ ] Severe lower extremity edema requiring containment and elevation
  - [ ] Open foot wounds requiring protection during wheelchair use
  - [ ] Severe spasticity requiring foot containment
  - [ ] Environmental protection needs
- [ ] **Clinical documentation:**
  - [ ] Edema severity (pitting, circumference measurements)
  - [ ] Wound location, size, stage if applicable
  - [ ] Spasticity level if applicable
  - [ ] Why standard footrests inadequate
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Medical documentation of edema, wounds, or positioning need
- [ ] Specific justification for foot box vs. standard footrests

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Document medical need (edema, wounds, protection)
- [ ] Clinical notes supporting need
- [ ] May need PA - check with DVS/eMedNY depending on cost

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Medical necessity not established"** - Generic request without specific indication. Fix: Document specific medical need: (1) Severe edema with measurements, (2) Open foot wounds with size/stage, (3) Severe spasticity requiring containment, or (4) Environmental protection need with explanation.

2. **"Standard footrests adequate"** - Insufficient justification for specialized equipment. Fix: Explain why standard footrests cannot address need. Example: "Standard elevating legrests provide elevation but no containment; patient requires enclosed foot box to contain severe bilateral edema and prevent dependent positioning"

3. **"Billed with new wheelchair at initial issue"** - Cannot bill separately at initial delivery. Fix: Foot box included at initial wheelchair issue if medically necessary. Bill E0954 separately only as replacement or addition after wheelchair delivered.

4. **"Prior authorization required"** (Medicaid) - PA not obtained. Fix: Check with DVS/eMedNY whether PA required based on cost. Obtain PA before ordering if required.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **specific medical indication** (edema, wounds, spasticity, environmental protection) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include **objective measurements** (edema circumference, wound size) when applicable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Explain **why standard footrests inadequate** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- SWO required before billing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Clinical notes** documenting severity of condition *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- May require **PA** depending on cost - check first *(Under Review)*
- Document medical need clearly (not cosmetic or convenience)

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Edema indication**: "Patient with CHF and chronic venous insufficiency; severe bilateral lower extremity edema with 3+ pitting, calf circumference 48cm (baseline 38cm); requires bilateral foot boxes for containment and elevation; standard elevating legrests provide elevation but no containment, resulting in dependent edema pooling at ankles"
- **Wound protection**: "Patient with Type 2 diabetes and left foot diabetic ulcer (2cm × 1.5cm, stage 2, lateral malleolus); requires left foot box for wound protection during wheelchair mobility; standard footrest exposes wound to environmental contamination and trauma risk"
- **Spasticity containment**: "Patient with T4 SCI and severe lower extremity spasticity; extensor spasms cause feet to thrust off standard footrests creating safety hazard; bilateral foot boxes contain spastic movements and maintain safe foot positioning"

## Related Codes

- **E0954** - Foot box (this code) - enclosed foot container
- **E0990** - Elevating legrest, complete assembly - provides elevation without enclosure
- **K0195** - Elevating leg rests, pair (capped rental) - for rental wheelchairs
- **E0995** - Calf rest/pad, replacement - accessory for elevating legrests
- **E1020** - Residual limb support system - for amputees (different from foot box)

**Note:** Foot box (E0954) provides enclosed containment. Elevating legrest (E0990) provides open elevation without enclosure. Choose appropriate code based on clinical need (containment vs. elevation alone).
