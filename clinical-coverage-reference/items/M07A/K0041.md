# K0041 - Large Size Footplate

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Footplates - Large Size
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Large size footplate for power wheelchair. Larger than standard footplate to accommodate larger feet, lower extremity edema, specialized footwear, or foot deformities. Standard footplates inadequate when foot size or specialized needs require additional surface area.

## Large vs. Standard Footplate

### Standard Footplate
- **Size:** Accommodates typical foot sizes (up to approximately men's size 11-12)
- **Use for:** Average foot size, no edema, standard footwear
- **Included:** Standard size included with wheelchair

### Large Footplate (K0041)
- **Size:** Larger dimensions to accommodate larger feet or special needs
- **Use for:** Men's size 13+, women's size 11+, edema, specialized footwear, deformities
- **Separately billable:** When not included or as replacement

## Clinical Indications

Large footplate indicated for:

### Larger Than Average Feet
- **Men's shoe size 13+:** Typically exceeds standard footplate capacity
- **Women's shoe size 11+:** May require large footplate
- **Tall stature:** Patients 6'3"+ often have proportionally larger feet
- **Foot measurement:** Foot length/width exceeds standard footplate dimensions

### Lower Extremity Edema
- **Lymphedema (I87.2):** Chronic lower extremity swelling
- **Diabetic edema (E11.621):** Swelling from diabetes complications
- **Venous insufficiency:** Swelling from poor venous return
- **CHF-related edema:** Swelling from heart failure
- **Fluctuating edema:** Large footplate accommodates varying swelling levels

### Specialized Footwear
- **Orthopedic shoes:** Extra depth, wider width for foot deformities
- **Diabetic shoes:** Deeper toe box, wider for ulcer prevention
- **AFO with shoe:** Ankle-foot orthosis attached to shoe (bulkier)
- **Post-surgical boots:** Higher, wider for post-operative protection
- **Protective footwear:** Larger/bulkier than standard shoes

### Foot Deformities
- **Bunions:** Severe bunions widen forefoot
- **Hammer toes:** Deformities create irregular foot shape
- **Charcot foot:** Deformity from diabetes affecting foot structure
- **Foot amputation with prosthesis:** Prosthetic foot may be wider
- **Post-surgical hardware:** Surgical reconstruction may widen foot

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Measurement of foot dimensions (length and width)
3. Reason for large footplate (large feet/edema/footwear/deformity)
4. Why standard footplate inadequate
5. How large footplate improves safety/function/comfort

### Foot Measurement Documentation

Measure and document:
- **Foot length:** Heel to longest toe (inches or cm)
- **Foot width:** Widest part of forefoot (inches or cm)
- **Shoe size:** Men's/women's shoe size
- **With/without footwear:** Measurements with regular footwear (or specialized footwear if applicable)
- **Comparison:** Show measurements exceed standard footplate dimensions

### Reason Documentation

Document ONE or MORE of:

**Large feet:**
- Shoe size [specify]
- Foot measurements exceed standard footplate capacity
- Standard footplate too small for safe foot support

**Edema:**
- Diagnosis causing edema [specify ICD-10]
- Extent of swelling [mild/moderate/severe]
- Foot dimensions with edema present
- Standard footplate inadequate when edematous

**Specialized footwear:**
- Type of specialized footwear [orthopedic shoes/AFO/diabetic shoes/boots]
- Reason for specialized footwear
- Footwear dimensions exceed standard footplate
- Photos/documentation of footwear if helpful

**Deformity:**
- Specific foot deformity [bunions/Charcot/amputation/etc.]
- How deformity affects foot dimensions
- Standard footplate cannot accommodate deformed foot shape

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None typically required** for initial issue or when not included
- **RB modifier** for replacement orders

### Units
- Bill per each footplate
- Order quantity based on patient need:
  - 1 footplate (one foot requires large size)
  - 2 footplates (both feet require large size)

### When Billable

**At initial issue:**
- If NOT included in wheelchair package
- Document large footplate need at initial evaluation

**As replacement:**
- Original large footplate damaged or worn
- RB modifier for replacement

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Check current codes; not specifically required

## Special Considerations

1. **Measurement critical:** Must document foot dimensions showing standard inadequate
2. **Safety focus:** Emphasize safety risks of footplate that's too small
3. **Included if documented:** May be included in wheelchair if documented at initial evaluation
4. **Per each footplate:** Order based on how many feet need large size (1 or 2)
5. **Specialized footwear:** Include photos/specifications if applicable
6. **Edema fluctuation:** Large footplate accommodates swelling variations
7. **Face-to-face not required:** For accessory alone

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Reason for large footplate:** Patient has [larger than average feet/lower extremity edema/specialized footwear needs/foot deformity] requiring large size footplate.

**Foot measurements:** [Specify measurements:]
- Foot length: [X] inches [left], [X] inches [right] (heel to longest toe)
- Foot width: [X] inches [left], [X] inches [right] (widest part of forefoot)
- Shoe size: [Men's/Women's] size [X]
[If specialized footwear:] - With [orthopedic shoes/AFO/diabetic shoes/boots]: length [X] inches, width [X] inches

**Why standard footplate inadequate:** Standard footplate dimensions [specify standard size if known] are inadequate because [foot measurements exceed standard capacity/edematous feet do not fit safely on standard footplate/specialized footwear does not fit on standard footplate/foot deformity creates irregular shape not accommodated by standard size]. [If applicable:] Foot overhangs standard footplate creating [pressure injury risk/unstable positioning/circulation compromise/fall risk].

**Safety/function concerns:** Standard footplate that is too small creates safety concerns: [foot overhangs edge risking pressure injury/unstable positioning risking falls/inadequate support affecting comfort and function]. Large footplate necessary to provide adequate support surface for safe wheelchair use.

**Clinical details:** [If edema:] Patient has [diagnosis] causing lower extremity edema [I87.2/E11.621]. Edema [severity level]. [If footwear:] Patient requires [type] footwear for [medical reason]. [If deformity:] Patient has [specific deformity] affecting foot shape.

[If at initial issue: Wheelchair configuration does not include large size footplates.] [If replacement: Original large footplate damaged/worn requiring replacement. RB modifier for replacement.]

Recommend large size footplate, quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both]."
