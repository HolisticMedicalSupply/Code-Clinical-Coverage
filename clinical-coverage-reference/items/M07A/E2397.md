# E2397 - Lithium-Based Battery

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Batteries - Lithium
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Lithium-based battery for power wheelchair. Modern battery technology offering lighter weight and longer lifespan than traditional sealed lead acid batteries. Must be compatible with wheelchair electronics and charging system.

## CRITICAL Frequency Limits

**E2397 (Lithium Battery):**
- Maximum **1 battery** at any **ONE TIME**
- Maximum **1 battery every 3 YEARS**

**Lead Acid Batteries (E2359, E2361, E2363, E2365, E2371, K0733):**
- Maximum **2 batteries** at any **ONE TIME**
- No 3-year frequency restriction

This is a major policy distinction between lithium and lead acid batteries.

## Lithium vs. Lead Acid Comparison

### Lithium Battery (E2397) Advantages
1. **Weight:** 50-70% lighter (20-30 lbs vs. 60-75 lbs for Group 27 lead acid)
2. **Lifespan:** 3-5 years vs. 1-2 years for lead acid
3. **Charge cycles:** 2000+ cycles vs. 300-500 cycles for lead acid
4. **Performance:** Better in cold weather, no sulfation, faster charging
5. **Maintenance:** No water addition, no acid leaks

### Lithium Battery (E2397) Considerations
1. **Cost:** Higher initial cost (offset by longer lifespan)
2. **Compatibility:** Not all wheelchairs compatible - must verify
3. **Charger:** May require lithium-specific charger
4. **Quantity:** Only 1 battery allowed (most wheelchairs use 1 lithium vs. 2 lead acid)
5. **Frequency:** Only 1 every 3 years (vs. more frequent lead acid replacements)

## Compatibility Requirements

### CRITICAL: Verify Wheelchair Compatibility

Before ordering E2397, verify:
1. **Wheelchair electronics** support lithium battery voltage profile
2. **Charger compatibility** - may need lithium-specific charger
3. **Manufacturer specifications** - wheelchair approved for lithium batteries
4. **Battery management system** - proper voltage cutoff and monitoring

### Documentation Requirements
- Manufacturer's compatibility statement OR
- Wheelchair model specifications confirming lithium compatibility OR
- Dealer/manufacturer confirmation that wheelchair model supports lithium batteries

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Wheelchair is compatible with lithium-based battery (manufacturer confirmation)
3. Battery not under manufacturer warranty
4. Battery specifications (voltage, capacity, manufacturer)
5. 3-year frequency requirement met (if replacement)

### Optional Justification for Lithium vs. Lead Acid
While not always required, may document:
- Weight reduction benefits (improved range, easier transport)
- Longer lifespan reduces replacement frequency
- Patient's usage pattern benefits from lithium advantages
- Cold weather use (lithium performs better in cold)
- Extended daily use (more charge cycles needed)

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **None required** - RB modifier NOT used for battery replacements

### Units
- Bill per each battery
- **ONLY 1 battery allowed at one time**
- Quantity must be 1 (not 2)

### Frequency Tracking
- Track last lithium battery date carefully
- Maximum 1 every 3 years
- If within 3 years of last lithium battery, claim may be denied

## Charger Considerations

Lithium batteries typically require specific charging profile:
- **Different from lead acid chargers** - standard lead acid charger may damage lithium battery
- **May need new charger** - verify current charger is lithium-compatible
- **If new charger needed:** Bill E2366 (single mode battery charger) separately if lithium-compatible charger required

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required for battery replacement
- **NY Medicaid:** May require PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Only 1 at a time:** Unlike lead acid (2 batteries), lithium allows only 1 battery
2. **3-year frequency:** Cannot replace more frequently than every 3 years
3. **Compatibility critical:** Wheelchair must support lithium batteries - verify before ordering
4. **Charger requirements:** May need lithium-specific charger - check current charger compatibility
5. **Weight advantage:** Significantly lighter than lead acid - document if relevant to patient needs
6. **Longer lifespan:** 3-5 years typical lifespan justifies 3-year replacement frequency
7. **Warranty verification:** Confirm battery not under manufacturer warranty
8. **Single battery configuration:** Most wheelchairs using lithium use 1 battery vs. 2 lead acid

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation]. Power wheelchair model [specify model] is compatible with lithium-based battery per manufacturer specifications [attach manufacturer documentation]. Current battery [describe condition: worn/end of lifespan/not under warranty]. [If replacement:] Last lithium battery provided [date - must be >3 years ago]. Battery not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Lithium-based battery medically necessary for power wheelchair operation. [Optional: Lithium battery provides significant weight reduction (approximately [X] lbs lighter than lead acid) benefiting patient's [mobility/transportation/range needs].] Wheelchair will use single lithium battery configuration. [If new charger needed:] Current charger not compatible with lithium battery - lithium-compatible charger required [see separate E2366 order]. Recommend lithium-based battery, [voltage], [capacity], [manufacturer], quantity 1."
