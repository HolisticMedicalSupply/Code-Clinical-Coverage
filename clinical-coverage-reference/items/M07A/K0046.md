# K0046 - Elevating Legrest Lower Extension Tube (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

K0046 represents the lower extension tube component of power wheelchair **ELEVATING LEGREST** system for **REPLACEMENT ONLY**. This is the vertical tube component that connects elevating legrest to wheelchair frame and allows height adjustment. **CRITICAL: K0046 is for ELEVATING legrests, NOT standard footrests** (standard footrest tube is K0043). Patient must meet elevating legrest medical necessity criteria before billing K0046.

Elevating legrest lower extension tubes are BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue with wheelchair bases and elevating legrests and **cannot be billed separately at initial delivery**. K0046 is only billable as replacement when original tube becomes damaged and patient continues to meet elevating legrest criteria.

**Key Features:**
- Lower extension tube for ELEVATING legrest (not standard footrest)
- Allows height adjustment of elevating legrest
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - BUNDLED at initial with elevating legrests
- Requires elevating legrest medical necessity criteria

**CRITICAL - Elevating Legrest Criteria:** Patient must meet ONE of these criteria:
1. **Cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion** (knee contracture, limited ROM)
2. **Significant lower extremity edema** (venous insufficiency, lymphedema, CHF)
3. **Has reclining back** (positioning with recline requires leg elevation)

**Cannot bill K0046 without documenting elevating legrest medical necessity.**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Elevating Legrest Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Meet ONE of These Three Criteria:

**1. Cannot Achieve 90-Degree Knee Flexion:**
- Knee contracture limiting flexion
- Limited knee range of motion (ROM)
- Orthopedic condition preventing 90-degree angle
- Post-surgical knee limitations
- ICD-10: M25.569 (knee pain/contracture), M24.56x (knee contracture)

**2. Significant Lower Extremity Edema:**
- Chronic venous insufficiency with edema
- Lymphedema of lower extremity
- Congestive heart failure (CHF) with dependent edema
- Peripheral edema requiring leg elevation
- ICD-10: I87.2 (venous insufficiency), I89.0 (lymphedema), I50.x (heart failure)

**3. Has Reclining Back on Wheelchair:**
- Power wheelchair with reclining back feature
- Positioning needs require coordinated recline and leg elevation
- Medical necessity for reclining back (pressure relief, positioning, respiratory)
- Elevating legrests coordinate with recline positioning

**Documentation Required:**
- Specify which criterion met (cannot be standard footrest without one of these)
- Clinical details supporting elevating legrest need
- How elevating legrest addresses medical condition

## Elevating Legrest vs. Standard Footrest

### K0046 (Elevating Legrest Tube):
- **For:** ELEVATING legrests that raise leg position
- **Requires:** One of three elevating legrest criteria
- **Use when:** Knee contracture OR lower extremity edema OR reclining back
- **Cannot use for:** Standard footrests without elevation capability

### K0043 (Standard Footrest Tube):
- **For:** Standard footrests at fixed 90-degree position
- **Does NOT require:** Elevating legrest criteria
- **Use when:** Standard footrest positioning adequate
- **More common:** Most patients use standard footrests

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0046 - Elevating legrest, lower extension tube, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] **KX modifier** (elevating legrest criteria met)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 + one of: M25.569, I87.2, I89.0)
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Document elevating legrest medical necessity:**
  - [ ] Cannot achieve 90-degree knee flexion (specify knee condition)
  - [ ] OR Significant lower extremity edema (specify cause: venous insufficiency, lymphedema, CHF)
  - [ ] OR Has reclining back (specify positioning need)
- [ ] **Detailed description of tube damage:**
  - [ ] Type of damage: bent, broken, cracked, worn mechanism
  - [ ] Functional impact on elevating legrest positioning
- [ ] **Documentation that tube cannot be repaired safely**
- [ ] **Quantity needed:** 1 or 2 tubes (specify which legrest: left/right/both)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document elevating legrest medical necessity (one of three criteria)
- [ ] Document specific damage requiring replacement
- [ ] Explain why repair not possible or safe
- [ ] Include KX modifier

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order + PA):**
- [ ] Obtain prior authorization for power wheelchair accessory
- [ ] Document elevating legrest medical necessity
- [ ] Same documentation as Medicare

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Elevating legrest criteria not met"** - Cannot document one of three elevating legrest criteria. Fix: Document specific criterion: "Patient has knee contracture preventing 90-degree knee flexion. ROM limited to 120 degrees flexion. Elevating legrest medically necessary to accommodate limited knee flexion." OR "Patient has chronic venous insufficiency with bilateral lower extremity edema. Leg elevation required for edema management."

2. **"Billed at initial wheelchair delivery"** - Attempting to bill K0046 when providing elevating legrests with new wheelchair. Fix: Do NOT bill K0046 at initial wheelchair issue with elevating legrests - tube is BUNDLED with elevating legrests at initial. Only bill K0046 as replacement on existing elevating legrest.

3. **"Standard footrest appropriate"** - Attempting to bill K0046 without elevating legrest criteria. Fix: K0046 is ONLY for elevating legrests. If patient does not meet elevating legrest criteria, use standard footrest (K0043) instead. Cannot bill K0046 for standard footrest tube.

4. **"Insufficient documentation of damage"** - Vague damage description. Fix: Provide specific details: "Left elevating legrest lower extension tube bent from impact. Bent tube prevents proper height adjustment and full elevation of legrest. Patient requires functional elevating legrest for [knee contracture/edema management/positioning with recline]."

5. **"Missing KX modifier"** - Billed without required modifier. Fix: KX modifier required to indicate elevating legrest criteria met and medical necessity for replacement.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document elevating legrest criteria FIRST** - specify which criterion met (knee flexion, edema, reclining back)
- Document **specific damage type** to elevating legrest tube
- Explain **why repair not feasible** for damaged tube
- Note patient **continues to meet elevating legrest criteria** for replacement
- Include **KX modifier** indicating criteria met
- SWO required before dispensing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Obtain prior authorization** for power wheelchair accessory before dispensing
- **Document elevating legrest medical necessity** clearly
- Same detailed documentation as Medicare
- Fiscal order from physician required

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Elevating legrest criteria:** "Patient has [knee contracture preventing 90-degree knee flexion/chronic venous insufficiency with lower extremity edema requiring elevation/reclining back requiring coordinated leg elevation]. Elevating legrest medically necessary for [accommodation of limited knee ROM/edema management/positioning with recline]."
- **Damage description:** "Left/Right elevating legrest lower extension tube [bent/broken/cracked] due to [impact/wear]. Damaged tube prevents [proper height adjustment/full elevation capability/secure positioning]. Patient continues to require functional elevating legrest for [knee contracture/edema management/reclining positioning]."
- **KX modifier justification:** "KX modifier: Elevating legrest medical necessity criteria met - [specify criterion]. Replacement of damaged tube necessary for continued elevating legrest function."
