# E2395 - Caster Wheel Rim/Hub (Excludes Tire)

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Wheel Replacements - Caster
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Caster wheel rim and hub for power wheelchair replacement. Wheel component only - does NOT include tire. For front (caster) wheels only. Use when wheel rim/hub is damaged but tire is reusable.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2395** (caster wheel, excludes tire): Front wheel rim/hub only - tire billed separately
- **E2394** (drive wheel, excludes tire): Rear wheel rim/hub only - tire billed separately
- **E2392** (caster tire with integrated wheel): Front wheel and tire as single unit - do NOT bill with E2395

## Component Breakdown

### Caster Wheel System Components
1. **Wheel rim/hub (E2395):** This code - bill when rim/hub damaged, tire reusable
2. **Tire (E2384, E2387, E2389, E2391):** Bill separately if tire also needs replacement
3. **Caster fork (E2396):** Bill separately if fork also damaged

### When to Use E2395 vs. E2392

**Use E2395 (wheel only) when:**
- Wheel rim/hub damaged but tire is functional and reusable
- More cost-effective to replace wheel only
- Wheelchair uses removable tire design (tire separates from wheel)

**Use E2392 (integrated tire/wheel) when:**
- Both tire and wheel need replacement
- Wheelchair uses integrated tire/wheel design
- May be more cost-effective to replace complete unit

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Caster wheel rim/hub damaged beyond safe use
3. Wheel not under manufacturer warranty
4. Specification of wheel damage (rim bent, hub bearing damaged, etc.)
5. Tire condition (if reusable, note that tire does not need replacement)

### Examples of Wheel Damage
- Bent or warped wheel rim (affects wheel rotation)
- Damaged or worn hub bearing (wheel doesn't spin freely)
- Cracked or fractured wheel rim (structural integrity compromised)
- Stripped axle mounting points (wheel won't secure properly)
- Impact damage to wheel structure
- Worn bearing races causing excessive play

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each wheel
- Typically 2 units (both front casters)
- Specify wheel size (must match tire size)

### Billing with Tire Codes

**If wheel damaged but tire reusable:**
- Bill E2395 only (wheel rim/hub)

**If both wheel and tire need replacement:**
- Bill E2395 (wheel rim/hub) AND
- Bill appropriate tire code: E2384, E2387, E2389, or E2391
- Do NOT bill E2392 (integrated tire/wheel)

**Do NOT bill together:**
- E2395 + E2392 (E2392 already includes wheel)

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** May require PA depending on cost

## Special Considerations

1. **Wheel only:** This code does NOT include tire - tire billed separately if needed
2. **Caster wheels:** Front wheels only; use E2394 for rear drive wheels
3. **Tire reusable:** Use when wheel damaged but tire functional - more cost-effective
4. **Size matching:** Wheel size must match tire size - specify wheel size in order
5. **Related component:** If caster fork (E2396) also damaged, bill separately
6. **Warranty verification:** Confirm wheel not under manufacturer warranty
7. **Replacement only:** Not included in initial wheelchair - for replacements only
