# K0045 - Footrest Complete Assembly (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

K0045 represents the complete footrest assembly for power wheelchair for **REPLACEMENT ONLY**. This includes all footrest components: upper hanger bracket (K0044), lower extension tube (K0043), footplate (K0042), and mounting hardware - one complete unit ready for installation. Complete assembly is BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue with K0043, K0044, wheelchair bases, and elevating legrests and **cannot be billed separately at initial delivery**. K0045 is only billable as replacement when footrest assembly is worn beyond individual component repair or multiple components are damaged.

**All requirements IDENTICAL to K0044** per source documentation.

**Key Features:**
- Complete footrest unit with all components
- Includes upper bracket, lower tube, footplate, hardware
- REPLACEMENT ONLY - BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue
- Use when multiple components damaged or complete assembly more cost-effective

**REPLACEMENT ONLY:** Complete footrest assembly is BUNDLED at initial with K0043, K0044, wheelchair bases, and elevating legrests. K0045 cannot be billed when delivering new wheelchair - only as replacement when damaged.

## Coverage Details

- **Fiscal order** from physician required
- **Medical necessity documentation** required

**Face-to-Face:** Not required for replacement accessory *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- Source indicates PA "varies by case" but "required for power wheelchair accessories"
- All requirements same as K0044
- Verify PA requirements with payer for specific case

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County**

## Complete Assembly Contents

**K0045 includes:**
1. **Upper hanger bracket (K0044):** Attaches to wheelchair frame, holds lower tube
2. **Lower extension tube (K0043):** Slides through bracket for height adjustment
3. **Footplate (K0042):** Attaches to bottom of tube, supports foot
4. **Mounting hardware:** All fasteners, connectors, hardware needed
5. **Complete unit:** Ready to install on wheelchair

**One complete footrest ready for installation**

## K0045 vs. Component Codes - Selection Logic

### When to Use K0045 (Complete Assembly)

**Use complete assembly when:**
- Multiple components damaged (bracket AND tube AND/or footplate)
- Extensive damage to footrest system requiring complete replacement
- Footrest worn beyond individual component repair
- Complete assembly more cost-effective than multiple component codes
- Easier installation with complete unit vs. assembling components
- Age-related wear affecting all components

### When to Use Component Codes Instead

**Use individual component codes when:**
- Only ONE component damaged
- Other components still functional
- More economical to replace single component
- Targeted component-level repair appropriate

**Component codes:**
- **K0044:** Upper hanger bracket only (top mounting bracket)
- **K0043:** Lower extension tube only (height adjustment tube)
- **K0042:** Footplate only (foot support platform)

**Cost Comparison:**
Compare allowable amounts for K0045 (complete assembly) vs. sum of K0043 + K0044 + K0042 (individual components) to determine most cost-effective approach.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "K0045 - Footrest, complete assembly, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] **KX modifier** (medical necessity requirements met)
- [ ] **RB modifier** (replacement of part)
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3, Z74.09)
- [ ] **Detailed description of footrest damage:**
  - [ ] Multiple components damaged OR extensive damage
  - [ ] Worn beyond individual component repair
  - [ ] How damage affects function
- [ ] **Justification for complete assembly** vs. component replacement
- [ ] **Documentation that repair not feasible**
- [ ] **Medical necessity for proper foot positioning**
- [ ] **Quantity needed:** 1 or 2 complete assemblies (specify which footrest: left/right/both)
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Document damage requiring complete assembly replacement
- [ ] Explain why complete assembly needed vs. component-level replacement
- [ ] Document medical necessity for functional footrest system
- [ ] Include KX and RB modifiers

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order + PA):**
- [ ] Obtain prior authorization for power wheelchair accessory
- [ ] Same documentation as Medicare
- [ ] Medical necessity for proper foot positioning

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Billed at initial wheelchair delivery"** - Attempting to bill K0045 with new wheelchair. Fix: Do NOT bill K0045 at initial wheelchair issue - complete footrest assembly is BUNDLED with wheelchair base, K0043, K0044, and elevating legrests. Only bill K0045 as replacement on existing wheelchair.

2. **"Component replacement more appropriate"** - Insufficient justification for complete assembly vs. individual components. Fix: Document why complete assembly needed: "Multiple components damaged (upper bracket cracked, lower tube bent) - complete assembly more cost-effective than separate K0044 + K0043" or "Footrest worn beyond component repair - all components at end of useful life."

3. **"Missing KX or RB modifier"** - Billed without required modifiers. Fix: Both KX and RB modifiers are required (same as K0044). KX indicates medical necessity requirements met. RB indicates replacement of part of DME item.

4. **"Insufficient documentation of medical necessity"** - Vague justification for replacement. Fix: Document medical necessity: "Patient requires functional footrest system for proper foot positioning during wheelchair use. Multiple footrest components damaged preventing proper lower extremity positioning. Complete assembly replacement necessary."

5. **"Prior authorization not obtained"** (NY Medicaid) - PA not submitted before service. Fix: For NY Medicaid, obtain prior authorization for power wheelchair accessories before dispensing. Same PA requirements as K0044.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document **multiple components damaged** or **extensive damage** requiring complete assembly
- Explain **why complete assembly more appropriate** than component-level replacement (cost-effective, multiple failures, worn beyond component repair)
- Document **medical necessity** for functional footrest system for proper foot positioning
- Include **both KX and RB modifiers** for proper billing (same as K0044)
- Note this is **replacement** on existing wheelchair (not bundled with new wheelchair)
- SWO required before dispensing

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Obtain prior authorization** for power wheelchair accessory before dispensing (same as K0044)
- Same detailed documentation as Medicare
- Fiscal order from physician required
- Document medical necessity for proper foot positioning

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Multiple components damaged:** "Left/Right footrest has multiple components damaged: [upper bracket cracked, lower tube bent, footplate worn]. Complete assembly replacement more cost-effective and appropriate than multiple individual component codes."
- **Worn beyond component repair:** "Footrest assembly worn beyond individual component repair due to [age/extensive use/wear]. All components at end of useful life. Replacing single component inadequate - complete assembly replacement necessary."
- **Medical necessity:** "Patient requires proper foot positioning with functional footrest system for wheelchair mobility and safe seating. Multiple footrest components damaged preventing proper positioning. KX modifier: medical necessity requirements met."
