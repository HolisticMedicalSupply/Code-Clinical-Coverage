# K0045 - Footrest Complete Assembly (Replacement)

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Footrest Complete Replacement
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Complete footrest assembly for power wheelchair replacement. Includes all footrest components: upper hanger bracket, lower extension tube, footplate, and mounting hardware. KX and RB modifiers required. BUNDLED at initial - FOR REPLACEMENT ONLY. All requirements IDENTICAL to K0044.

## Complete Assembly Contents

**K0045 includes:**
1. **Upper hanger bracket (K0044):** Attaches to wheelchair frame
2. **Lower extension tube (K0043):** Adjusts footrest height
3. **Footplate (K0042):** Supports foot
4. **Mounting hardware:** All fasteners, connectors, hardware needed
5. **Complete unit:** Ready to install on wheelchair

**One complete footrest ready for installation**

## K0045 vs. Component Codes

### When to Use K0045 (Complete Assembly)

**Use complete assembly when:**
- Multiple components damaged (bracket AND tube AND/or footplate)
- Extensive damage to footrest system
- Footrest worn beyond individual component repair
- Complete assembly more cost-effective than multiple component codes
- Easier installation with complete unit vs. assembling components

### When to Use Component Codes

**Use individual component codes when:**
- Only ONE component damaged
- Other components still functional
- More economical to replace single component

**Component codes:**
- **K0044:** Upper hanger bracket only
- **K0043:** Lower extension tube only
- **K0042:** Footplate only

## CRITICAL: Bundled at Initial / Replacement Only

**K0045 BUNDLED at initial wheelchair issue:**
- INCLUDED in base wheelchair price
- Bundled with K0043, K0044, wheelchair bases, elevating legrests
- CANNOT bill K0045 when delivering new wheelchair

**K0045 billable ONLY as replacement:**
- Only when replacing damaged footrest assembly on existing wheelchair
- Must be outside manufacturer warranty
- KX and RB modifiers required

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document for Replacement (Same as K0044)

1. Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility
2. Footrest assembly worn or damaged beyond individual component repair
3. Multiple components damaged OR extensive damage
4. Patient requires functional footrest for proper lower extremity positioning
5. Footrest outside manufacturer warranty

### Damage Documentation

**Document why complete assembly needed vs. component replacement:**

**Multiple components damaged:**
- Upper bracket cracked/broken AND lower tube bent
- Lower tube worn AND footplate damaged
- Multiple failure points requiring complete replacement
- More cost-effective to replace complete assembly

**Extensive damage:**
- Impact damage affecting multiple components
- Severe wear throughout footrest system
- Structural compromise across multiple points
- Component-level repair inadequate

**Worn beyond component repair:**
- Age-related wear affecting all components
- Multiple components at end of useful life
- Replacing one component leaves other worn components
- Complete replacement more practical

**Why complete assembly appropriate:**
- Multiple component codes would be needed separately
- Complete assembly ensures matched components
- Installation efficiency with complete unit
- Cost comparison shows assembly cost-effective

### Warranty Documentation

**CRITICAL:** Must document outside warranty
- Verify warranty end date
- If within warranty, pursue warranty claim with manufacturer
- If outside warranty, document warranty expiration date

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers (Same as K0044)

**Both modifiers required:**
- **KX** (required) - Requirements specified in medical policy have been met
- **RB** (required for replacement) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each complete footrest assembly
- Order quantity based on need:
  - 1 assembly (single footrest needs complete replacement)
  - 2 assemblies (both footrests need complete replacement)

### Cost Considerations

Compare costs:
- **K0045 (complete assembly):** Single code for entire footrest
- **K0043 + K0044 + K0042 (components):** Multiple codes if all damaged

Choose most cost-effective approach based on:
- Number of components damaged
- Payer allowable amounts for each code
- Installation efficiency

## Prior Authorization (Same as K0044)

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Varies by case - required for power wheelchair accessories

## Special Considerations

1. **All requirements IDENTICAL to K0044:** Coverage, modifiers, documentation same
2. **BUNDLED at initial:** Cannot bill when delivering new wheelchair
3. **Complete vs. components:** Choose based on extent of damage and cost-effectiveness
4. **KX and RB modifiers:** Both required (same as K0044)
5. **Includes all parts:** Upper bracket, lower tube, footplate, hardware
6. **Face-to-face only with new PWC:** Not required for replacement alone
7. **Warranty critical:** Must be outside manufacturer warranty

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/part-time].

**Footrest damage requiring complete assembly:** [Left/Right/Both] footrest assembly damaged/worn requiring complete replacement. Damage to multiple components: [describe damage to upper bracket, lower tube, and/or footplate - e.g., 'upper bracket cracked, lower tube bent from impact, footplate worn'].

**Why complete assembly needed:** Complete footrest assembly (K0045) appropriate because [multiple components damaged requiring coordinated replacement/extensive damage throughout footrest system/footrest worn beyond individual component repair/complete assembly more cost-effective than multiple component codes K0043 + K0044 + K0042].

**Component vs. assembly decision:** [If considering components:] Individual component replacement considered but inadequate due to [extent of damage across multiple components/age and wear of other components/cost comparison favoring complete assembly]. Complete assembly ensures matched, coordinated components.

**Functional impact:** Damaged footrest assembly prevents proper lower extremity positioning by [describe functional problems]. Patient requires functional footrest system for [wheelchair mobility/safe seating/leg support during daily wheelchair use].

**Medical necessity:** Patient requires proper lower extremity positioning with functional footrest system. KX modifier: medical necessity requirements met.

**Warranty status:** Footrest assembly outside manufacturer warranty. Wheelchair purchased [date]. Manufacturer warranty expired [date]. [Verify warranty documentation if available.]

**Replacement vs. initial:** This is REPLACEMENT of damaged footrest assembly on existing wheelchair (not new wheelchair delivery). Original footrest included with wheelchair at initial issue. RB modifier for replacement of part.

Recommend footrest complete assembly replacement (K0045), quantity [1 or 2] [specify left/right or both], KX and RB modifiers."
