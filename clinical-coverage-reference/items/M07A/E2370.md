# E2370 - Integrated Motor/Gear Box (Replacement)

## Clinical Overview

E2370 represents replacement integrated motor/gear box units for power wheelchairs. "Integrated" means motor and gear box combined as single unit. Some manufacturers use integrated units that must be replaced as complete assembly (cannot separate). Same coverage as E2368/E2369 but typically higher cost.

**Key Features:**
- Integrated motor and gear box (single unit)
- Cannot separate motor from gear box
- Manufacturer-specific design
- Typically higher cost than separate components
- RB modifier required
- Must be outside warranty period

## Coverage Details

**Same coverage as E2368 (drive wheel motor) - all requirements identical except this is integrated unit.**

**Covered:** Yes (replacement only)

**All requirements same as E2368:**
- SWO required
- NO PA (Medicare)
- NO face-to-face required
- Documentation of failure
- Proof outside warranty
- RB modifier required
- May require PA for Medicaid (typically higher cost)

## Prescription Checklist

**Same as E2368 except:**
- [ ] Specify: **Integrated motor/gear box unit**
- [ ] Document cannot replace motor or gear box separately
- [ ] Typically higher cost - may need cost justification

**All other requirements identical to E2368.**

## Common Denial Reasons

**Same as E2368 plus:**

**"Should use separate components"** - Question whether integrated unit necessary. Fix: Document manufacturer requirement: "Patient's power wheelchair (manufacturer: Quantum) uses integrated motor/gear box units; motor and gear box cannot be replaced separately per manufacturer design; integrated unit E2370 required for this wheelchair model; separate motor (E2368) or gear box (E2369) not compatible."

## Tips for Approval

**Same as E2368 plus:**
- **Document integrated unit requirement** (manufacturer-specific)
- **Explain why cannot use separate components**
- Typically higher cost - cost justification helpful

## Related Codes

- **E2368** - Drive wheel motor replacement (separate)
- **E2369** - Drive wheel gear box replacement (separate)
- **E2370** - Integrated motor/gear box (this code - combined unit)

## E2368 vs E2369 vs E2370 Decision Tree

**Use E2368** (motor) when:
- Motor failed, gear box OK
- Can replace motor separately

**Use E2369** (gear box) when:
- Gear box failed, motor OK
- Can replace gear box separately

**Use E2370** (integrated) when:
- Motor and/or gear box failed
- Wheelchair uses integrated unit design
- Cannot replace components separately (manufacturer requirement)
