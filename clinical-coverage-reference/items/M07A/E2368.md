## Prescription Checklist

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E2368 - Drive wheel motor, replacement only"**
- [ ] **Modifier: RB (replacement part)**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (Z99.3 wheelchair dependence)
- [ ] **Motor failure documentation:**
  - [ ] Which motor failed (right/left drive wheel motor)
  - [ ] Problem description (motor not functioning, burning smell, no power, etc.)
  - [ ] How motor failure affects wheelchair function
  - [ ] When failure occurred
- [ ] **Warranty status:**
  - [ ] Wheelchair age/purchase date
  - [ ] Warranty period
  - [ ] Statement replacement NOT covered under warranty
- [ ] **Functional impact:**
  - [ ] How motor failure affects patient mobility
  - [ ] Why replacement medically necessary
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO):**
- [ ] Written order for motor replacement
- [ ] Documentation of motor failure
- [ ] Proof not covered under warranty
- [ ] Description of problem
- [ ] RB modifier for replacement

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Documentation of failure

- [ ] Cost estimate
- [ ] May need PA if high cost - check first

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Under warranty"** - Motor should be covered by wheelchair warranty. Fix: Document wheelchair outside warranty period: "Patient's power wheelchair purchased 3 years ago; standard warranty expired after 1-2 years; wheelchair now outside warranty period; left drive wheel motor failed; motor replacement not covered under warranty; E2368 medically necessary to restore wheelchair function."

2. **"Motor failure not documented"** - Missing description of problem. Fix: Provide specific description of motor failure: "Patient's right drive wheel motor stopped functioning; motor makes clicking noise but does not turn wheel; wheelchair cannot move or can only turn left; patient tested wheelchair - right wheel will not turn even with joystick input; motor failure confirmed preventing wheelchair operation; motor replacement medically necessary for wheelchair function."

3. **"No RB modifier"** - Missing replacement modifier. Fix: ALWAYS use RB modifier for replacement parts: "E2368 billed with RB modifier indicating replacement of wheelchair component. RB modifier required for motor replacement per Medicare policy."

4. **"Functional impact unclear"** - Not clear why replacement needed. Fix: Link motor failure to patient mobility and safety: "Patient's power wheelchair left drive motor failed; wheelchair cannot move straight, only turns in circles to right; patient unable to use wheelchair for mobility creating bed confinement; patient wheelchair-dependent for all mobility due to MS; motor replacement medically necessary to restore safe functional wheelchair operation."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document motor failure specifically** (which motor, what problem) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Proof outside warranty period** (wheelchair age, purchase date) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **RB modifier REQUIRED** for replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Functional impact** (how motor failure affects mobility) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Simple replacement part - minimal documentation

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Documentation of failure** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Warranty status** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Cost estimate** required
- **May require PA** if high cost - check first
