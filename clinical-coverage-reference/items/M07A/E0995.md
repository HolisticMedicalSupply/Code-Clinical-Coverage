## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **HCPCS code: "E0995 - Calf rest/pad, replacement only, each"**
- [ ] **RB modifier** (replacement - REQUIRED for Medicare)
- [ ] **Quantity: Typically 2 (one for each elevating legrest)**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (same as elevating legrest indication - edema, orthopedic, etc.)
- [ ] **PREREQUISITE VERIFICATION:**
  - [ ] Patient has covered elevating legrests (E0990)
  - [ ] Elevating legrests currently in use
- [ ] **Replacement justification:**
  - [ ] Current calf pad(s) worn/damaged
  - [ ] Padding compressed and no longer provides adequate support
  - [ ] Cannot be repaired
  - [ ] Replacement necessary for continued use of elevating legrests
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare (SWO with RB modifier):**
- [ ] Must have covered elevating legrests
- [ ] Documentation of wear/damage
- [ ] RB modifier on claim

**For NY Medicaid (Fiscal Order):**
- [ ] Specify "calf rest/pad replacement"
- [ ] Must have covered elevating legrests
- [ ] Justification for replacement

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No elevating legrests on wheelchair"** - Patient doesn't have elevating legrests. Fix: Calf pads only applicable if patient has elevating legrests (E0990). If patient has standard footrests (not elevating), calf pads are not applicable. Verify patient has covered elevating legrests before ordering calf pad replacements.

2. **"Billed at initial elevating legrest issue"** - E0995 billed with new elevating legrests. Fix: Calf pads INCLUDED with elevating legrests (E0990) at initial issue. E0995 can ONLY be billed as replacement after elevating legrests delivered. Use RB modifier.

3. **"Missing RB modifier"** (Medicare) - Replacement billing without RB modifier. Fix: RB modifier REQUIRED for replacement billing. Add RB modifier to claim.

4. **"Frequency exceeded"** - Requesting replacement <5 years from last replacement. Fix: Medicare allows 2 calf pads per wheelchair every 5 years. If requesting earlier replacement, provide detailed justification (excessive wear, patient factors, wheelchair use patterns).

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **RB modifier MANDATORY** for replacement billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Must have covered elevating legrests** (E0990) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Cannot bill at initial elevating legrest issue - **included with E0990** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document **wear/damage** requiring replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Clearly state "**calf rest/pad replacement**" in fiscal order *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Must have covered elevating legrests** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Justify replacement (worn, damaged)
- Generally no PA needed for minor accessory replacement

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Replacement justification**: "Patient has covered elevating legrests (E0990) for chronic lower extremity edema; calf pads worn and padding compressed after 4 years of use; no longer provide adequate calf support during leg elevation; replacement necessary for continued effective use of elevating legrests"
- **Prerequisite verification**: "Patient has elevating legrests on power wheelchair (E0990 approved 06/15/2020 for chronic venous insufficiency with lower extremity edema); elevating legrests currently in use daily for edema management; calf pads require replacement due to wear"
