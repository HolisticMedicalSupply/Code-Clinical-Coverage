# E2391 - Solid Rubber/Plastic Caster Tire (Removable)

**Category:** Power Wheelchair Accessories
**Subcategory:** Tire Replacements - Solid Rubber/Plastic
**BOC Code:** M07A

## Description

Solid rubber or solid plastic caster tire for power wheelchair replacement. Removable design - tire can be replaced separately from wheel rim. Most durable caster tire option. Provides maximum puncture resistance and longest service life. Firmest ride quality. For front (caster) wheels only.

## Key Distinctions

- **E2391** (solid rubber/plastic removable): Most durable caster tire - tire separates from wheel, firmest ride
- **E2392** (solid rubber/plastic integrated): Same durability but tire and wheel as single unit
- **E2389** (solid foam caster): Very durable - firm ride, less durable than E2391
- **E2387** (foam-filled caster): Durable - medium cushioning, puncture-proof
- **E2384** (pneumatic caster): Least durable - best cushioning, requires maintenance
- **E2390** (solid rubber/plastic drive): Same durability but for rear wheels

## Removable vs. Integrated Design

### E2391 (Removable) - Tire Only
- Tire can be removed/replaced separately from wheel rim
- Wheel rim is reusable when replacing tire
- Bill E2391 for tire only (wheel rim not included)
- More economical if wheel rim still functional

### E2392 (Integrated) - Tire + Wheel Unit
- Tire and wheel manufactured as single unit
- Cannot separate tire from wheel
- Must replace entire tire/wheel assembly
- Bill E2392 for complete tire/wheel unit
- May be more expensive than E2391

## Medical Necessity Criteria

### Must Document (Same as E2390)
1. Power wheelchair is covered by Medicare/Medicaid
2. Front caster tires worn or damaged beyond safe use
3. Tires not under manufacturer warranty
4. Medical necessity for solid rubber/plastic vs. other tire types
5. Confirm removable design (tire separates from wheel)

### Justification for Solid Rubber/Plastic Casters
Choose E2391 when patient requires:
- Maximum durability for front wheels
- Consistency with drive wheel tire selection (if using E2390)
- Longest caster tire lifespan
- Maximum puncture resistance
- Zero maintenance requirements
- Very heavy use pattern or extreme use environment

## Billing Guidelines

### Modifiers
- **RB** (required) - Replacement of part of DME item

### Units
- Bill per each tire
- Typically 2 units (both front casters)
- Specify tire size, solid rubber/plastic construction, and removable design

### Important Billing Note
- E2391 is for TIRE ONLY (removable from wheel)
- If tire and wheel are integrated unit, use E2392 instead

## Prior Authorization

- **Medicare:** NO PA required
- **NY Medicaid:** Generally no PA

## Special Considerations

1. **Same as E2390:** All requirements identical to E2390; only differences are wheel position (front vs. rear) and removable design
2. **Caster wheels:** Front wheels that swivel for steering - typically smaller than drive wheels
3. **Removable design:** Tire separates from wheel - more economical if wheel rim still functional
4. **Most durable caster option:** Longest service life of all caster tire types (tied with E2392)
5. **Firmest ride:** Least cushioning - assess patient tolerance
6. **Completely maintenance-free:** No air pressure, no flats, no repairs
7. **Typically matched:** If using solid rubber/plastic drive wheels (E2390), usually use solid rubber/plastic casters (E2391 or E2392)
8. **Warranty verification:** Confirm tires not under manufacturer warranty before ordering

## Documentation Template

"Patient uses power wheelchair for mobility [full-time/community ambulation] with [describe heavy use pattern/extreme environment]. Front caster tires worn [describe wear pattern/damage]. Tires not under manufacturer warranty [verify date]. Wheelchair uses removable caster tire design (tire separates from wheel rim). Solid rubber/plastic caster tires medically necessary due to [maximum durability requirements/consistency with drive wheel selection E2390/very heavy use pattern/extreme use environment]. Patient requires longest service life and maximum puncture resistance for caster tires. [Confirm patient tolerates firm ride]. Recommend replacement with solid rubber/plastic removable caster tires, size [specify], quantity 2 (both front casters)."
