- SEALED lead acid type: gel cell OR absorbed glass mat (AGM)
- Maintenance-free (sealed design)
- No risk of acid leakage
- Replacement only (batteries included with initial wheelchair)
- Billed per each battery
- Up to 2 batteries at any one time per LCD L33792

**Typical Clinical Context:**

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Under warranty"** - Batteries should be covered by wheelchair warranty. Fix: Document wheelchair outside warranty period: "Patient's power wheelchair purchased 18 months ago in April 2024; standard wheelchair warranty expired after 12 months (April 2025); wheelchair now outside warranty period; batteries worn from normal daily use; replacement batteries not covered under warranty; E2359 replacement medically necessary."

2. **"Non-sealed battery ordered"** - E2358 or E2360 (non-sealed) billed instead of E2359 (sealed). Fix: ONLY sealed batteries covered. Order E2359 (sealed) not E2358/E2360 (non-sealed): "Order Group 27 SEALED lead acid batteries (E2359), gel cell type; non-sealed batteries not covered per LCD L33792."

3. **"More than 2 batteries requested"** - Quantity exceeds LCD limit. Fix: LCD L33792 allows UP TO 2 batteries at any one time: "Patient's power wheelchair uses 2 batteries (standard configuration); ordering 2 units of E2359 (one pair) per LCD L33792 allowance of up to 2 batteries at any one time."

4. **"Power wheelchair coverage not documented"** - Missing proof wheelchair meets coverage criteria. Fix: Document wheelchair meets power mobility criteria: "Patient has covered Group 2 power wheelchair (K0822) meeting power mobility criteria per LCD L33789; patient with MS has significant mobility limitation requiring power wheelchair for safe functional mobility; batteries required for wheelchair operation; replacement batteries medically necessary for continued wheelchair function."

5. **"Battery condition not documented"** - Unclear why replacement needed. Fix: Document battery wear and functional impact: "Patient's power wheelchair batteries diminished capacity from 2 years of daily use; wheelchair range reduced from 15 miles to 3 miles on full charge inadequate for patient's daily activities; batteries no longer holding adequate charge; replacement batteries medically necessary to restore wheelchair range for patient's community mobility needs."

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Document wheelchair outside warranty** (age, purchase date) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **ONLY sealed batteries** - specify gel cell or absorbed glass mat *(Verified - High Confidence)*
- **Up to 2 batteries maximum** - typical order is 2 units *(Verified - High Confidence)*
- **Battery wear/diminished capacity** documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Power wheelchair meets coverage criteria** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Simple replacement - minimal documentation required

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Wheelchair meets WME criteria** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Proof outside warranty** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **May require PA** if frequent replacements *(Under Review)*
- **Delivery within 30 days**

**Clinical Documentation Best Practices:**
- **Standard battery replacement**: "Patient uses power wheelchair (K0822 Group 2) for all mobility due to progressive MS; wheelchair purchased March 2023 (2+ years old), outside warranty period; batteries show diminished capacity from daily use; wheelchair range reduced from 15 miles per charge to 4 miles per charge; inadequate for patient's daily activities (work commute 6 miles); batteries no longer holding adequate charge for functional use; replacement of 2 Group 27 sealed lead acid batteries (E2359 x 2 units, gel cell type) medically necessary to restore wheelchair range and enable patient's essential mobility for work and community access"

- **Rapid battery wear**: "Patient uses power wheelchair (K0841 Group 3) 12-14 hours daily for all mobility; heavy use accelerated battery wear; wheelchair purchased January 2024 (22 months old), outside 1-year warranty; batteries will not hold charge >3 hours limiting patient to home only; patient requires 8-10 hour range for employment (office job); current battery capacity inadequate for work attendance; replacement of 2 Group 27 sealed batteries (E2359 x 2 units, absorbed glass mat type) medically necessary to restore adequate wheelchair range for employment and community mobility"

- **Battery failure**: "Patient's power wheelchair batteries failed to hold charge; wheelchair purchased August 2023 (26 months old), outside warranty; batteries only charge to 40% capacity despite proper charging; wheelchair range 2 miles inadequate for patient's essential mobility needs (medical appointments, shopping); patient with C6 SCI wheelchair-dependent for all mobility; replacement of 2 Group 27 sealed batteries (E2359 x 2 units) medically necessary for continued wheelchair function and essential mobility"

## Battery Size Selection

**Group 27** (E2359) - This code:
- Standard size for many power wheelchairs
- Physical dimensions: approx. 12.0" L x 6.8" W x 8.9" H
- Typical capacity: 75-100 Ah
- Most common size for Group 2 and some Group 3 power wheelchairs

**Other Sizes:**
- **Group 24** (E2361) - Smaller: 10.2" L x 6.8" W x 8.9" H
- **Group 22NF** (E2363) - Specific models: 9.5" L x 6.9" W x 8.3" H
- **U-1** (E2365) - Compact: 7.8" L x 5.2" W x 7.2" H
- **Group 34** (K0733) - Larger: 10.2" L x 6.8" W x 7.9" H

**Match battery size to wheelchair specification.** Check wheelchair manual or manufacturer specification for correct battery group size.

## Quantity Limit - Up to 2 Batteries

**LCD L33792 states: "up to 2 batteries" allowed at any one time.**

**Typical Scenarios:**
- **Standard configuration**: Most power wheelchairs use 2 batteries (one pair) → Order 2 units of E2359
- **Single battery wheelchair**: Some compact wheelchairs use 1 battery → Order 1 unit of E2359
- **Cannot order >2 batteries** at once per LCD limit
