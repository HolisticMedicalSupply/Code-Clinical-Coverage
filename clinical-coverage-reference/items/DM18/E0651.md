# E0651 - Segmental Pneumatic Compression Pump (No Manual Control)

## Clinical Overview

E0651 is a segmental (multi-chamber) pneumatic compression pump without calibrated gradient pressure control. This mid-tier pump has multiple outflow ports delivering sequential compression to different limb segments, but all chambers operate at the same pressure or with a predetermined gradient - no manual individual chamber adjustment capability. Used when segmented compression is medically beneficial but individual chamber pressure control (E0652) is not medically necessary.

**Key Distinction:** E0651 provides sequential compression across multiple chambers, but the prescriber cannot manually adjust individual chamber pressures. All chambers inflate at same pressure or follow factory-preset gradient.

**ðŸš¨ MEDICAID UPDATE (October 2025):** NY Medicaid changed E0651 from prior approval to DVS authorization, simplifying the approval process.

**Coverage Criteria:** Same as E0650 - lymphedema after 4-week conservative failure OR CVI with ulcers after 6-month conservative failure. Must justify why segmented compression needed vs. basic E0650.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

Must meet **SAME** criteria as E0650:

**Option 1: Lymphedema (Primary or Secondary)**
1. **Diagnosis of lymphedema** - Primary or secondary lymphedema confirmed
2. **Failed 4-week conservative therapy trial** including ALL:
   - Compression garments â‰¥30mmHg worn daily
   - Elevation exercises performed
   - Limb elevation protocol *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Objective measurements** documenting edema
4. **Conservative therapy dates documented**

**Option 2: Chronic Venous Insufficiency with Ulcers**
1. **Diagnosis of CVI with venous stasis ulcers** - Lower extremity only
2. **Failed 6-month conservative therapy trial**
3. **Ulcer documentation** - Location, size, characteristics
4. **Lower extremity only** - CVI with ulcers coverage limited to legs

**PLUS: Justification for E0651 vs. E0650**

Must document **WHY segmented compression medically necessary** over nonsegmented E0650:
- Lymphedema severity requiring sequential distal-to-proximal compression *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Failed trial or inadequate response with E0650 nonsegmented pump *(Under Review)*
- Clinical need for sequential compression but NOT individual chamber control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complex edema pattern benefiting from segmented approach *(Under Review)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Same as E0650:**
  - WOPD required before delivery
  - Face-to-face encounter documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No justification for segmented compression"** - E0651 ordered without explaining why needed vs. E0650. Fix: Must document clinical rationale for segmented sequential compression. Explain lymphedema severity, complexity, or inadequate response to nonsegmented compression. Sequential compression provides distal-to-proximal gradual pressure transition beneficial for complex edema patterns. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Should use E0650 instead"** - Insufficient medical necessity for segmented device. Fix: Document specific reasons E0650 inadequate: failed trial with nonsegmented pump showing poor edema response, lymphedema extending across multiple limb segments requiring sequential compression, clinical assessment showing segmented approach medically superior. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Should use E0652 instead"** - Clinical presentation suggests need for manual chamber control. Fix: If patient has unique characteristics (trunk involvement, complex anatomy), E0652 with calibrated gradient may be required. Review if manual pressure adjustment truly needed. Otherwise, document why predetermined gradient (E0651) sufficient vs. manual control (E0652). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Conservative therapy trial insufficient"** - Same as E0650 denial. Fix: Must document full 4-week trial for lymphedema OR 6-month trial for CVI with ulcers. Include dates, garment grade (â‰¥30mmHg), compliance, why failed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No objective measurements"** - Missing limb measurements. Fix: Document measurements at multiple points showing persistent edema despite conservative therapy. Compare measurements over time. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Missing financial attestation"** (Medicare) - No prescriber financial disclosure. Fix: Include financial attestation with WOPD stating no financial relationship with DME supplier.

7. **"Nonsegmented appliance ordered"** - E0660-E0666 ordered with E0651. Fix: E0651 segmental pump should be paired with segmented appliances (E0667, E0668, E0669) or trunk/chest appliances (E0656, E0657). For nonsegmented appliances, use E0650 pump instead. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Meet all E0650 requirements first (conservative therapy failure, measurements, WOPD, F2F, financial attestation)
- **Key to approval: Strong justification for segmented compression** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Example: "Patient's lymphedema extends from hand to axilla requiring sequential compression from distal to proximal. Nonsegmented E0650 pump provides uniform pressure insufficient for graduated compression needed across multiple arm segments. E0651 segmented pump provides sequential chamber inflation addressing complex multi-segment edema pattern. Manual chamber control (E0652) not required as predetermined gradient adequate."
- Document lymphedema severity/complexity requiring sequential approach *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- If patient tried E0650 and failed, document that trial and inadequate response *(Under Review)*
- Explain why predetermined gradient (E0651) sufficient vs. manual control (E0652) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Vascular or lymphedema specialist evaluation strengthens case *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- DVS authorization pathway simplified process (October 2025) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Still must justify segmented compression need
- Fiscal order should clearly explain:
  - Why E0650 insufficient
  - Clinical benefits of sequential compression
  - Lymphedema characteristics requiring segmented approach *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Document conservative therapy thoroughly (4 weeks lymphedema, 6 months CVI)
- Face-to-face encounter documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify segmented appliance needed (E0667/E0668/E0669)
