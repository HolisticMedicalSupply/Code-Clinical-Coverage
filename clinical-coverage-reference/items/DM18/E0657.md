# E0657 - Chest Pneumatic Compression Appliance (Segmented)

## Clinical Overview

E0657 is a specialized segmented pneumatic compression appliance for chest wall compression. Most commonly prescribed for post-mastectomy lymphedema with chest wall involvement or post-surgical lymphedema affecting the anterior chest beyond what standard arm sleeves can cover. This complex device requires E0652 compressor with manually calibrated gradient control due to the complexity and sensitivity of chest compression.

**Key Features:**
- Covers chest/chest wall beyond limb boundaries
- Segmented design with multiple chambers
- **REQUIRES E0652 pump with manual chamber control**
- Most common indication: Post-mastectomy lymphedema with chest wall involvement

**Typical Indication:**
- Post-mastectomy lymphedema extending onto chest wall
- Post-surgical lymphedema affecting anterior chest
- Lymphedema extending from arm onto chest beyond standard sleeve limits *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL:** This is a complex, high-tier device. Only appropriate when lymphedema extends beyond standard arm appliance coverage onto chest wall, requiring specialized compression with manual chamber control.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Should use arm-only appliances"** - Chest compression not justified. Fix: Must document lymphedema extending onto chest wall beyond standard arm appliance boundaries. Show chest measurements documenting chest wall involvement. Explain why arm-only appliances (E0665, E0668) cannot adequately manage lymphedema extending to chest. Example: "Post-mastectomy lymphedema extends from arm onto anterior chest wall. Arm appliance (E0665) only covers to shoulder - chest wall involvement requires E0657 chest appliance to address lymphedema on chest beyond arm coverage." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"E0650 or E0651 pump ordered"** - Wrong pump type. Fix: E0657 chest appliance **REQUIRES E0652 pump** with manually calibrated gradient control. Cannot be used with E0650 or E0651. Chest compression complexity and sensitivity necessitate manual chamber pressure adjustment. Must order E0652 pump with E0657 appliance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"E0652 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0657 appliance coverage absolutely depends on E0652 compressor approval. Ensure E0652 meets all NCD 280.6 criteria: unique patient characteristics (chest involvement), failed trials of E0650/E0651, comprehensive documentation. Cannot approve E0657 without approved E0652 pump. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No chest measurements"** - Missing documentation of chest involvement. Fix: Must document measurements showing lymphedema extends onto chest wall. Include chest circumference, measurements of specific chest wall areas affected. Demonstrate lymphedema beyond arm boundaries onto chest. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No failed trial of arm-only treatment"** - E0657 requested without prior limb-only trial. Fix: Typically must document trial of arm-only appliances (E0650/E0651 with E0665 or E0668) showing inadequate control of lymphedema extending to chest. Example: "4-week trial of E0651 with E0665 full arm appliance showed arm edema improved but chest wall involvement progressed. Arm appliance covers to shoulder only - chest wall lymphedema requires E0657 chest appliance." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Medical necessity for chest compression not explained"** - Vague justification. Fix: Must clearly explain why chest compression medically necessary. Document specific chest wall areas affected by lymphedema, why these areas cannot be managed without chest appliance, expected clinical benefits. Post-mastectomy cases should document surgical history and chest wall involvement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No post-surgical history"** - Missing mastectomy/surgical details. Fix: For post-mastectomy lymphedema, document mastectomy date/type, chest wall involvement, radiation therapy if received. Surgical history supports medical necessity and explains etiology. Not required for all cases but strengthens approval for post-mastectomy indication. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"No specialist evaluation"** (Medicaid) - Complex device without specialist input. Fix: Medicaid PA for E0657 strongly enhanced by lymphedema specialist or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation documenting chest involvement and medical necessity for specialized chest appliance. Not explicitly required but greatly strengthens approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

9. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Missing or incomplete conservative therapy. Fix: Same as E0652 requirements - must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial including compression garments â‰¥30mmHg, elevation, exercise. Include dates, compliance, why failed.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **This is highest-tier, complex appliance - strongest documentation required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Focus on E0652 compressor approval first - appliance absolutely depends on pump
- **Key to approval: Document chest wall involvement beyond arm boundaries** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Chest measurements showing lymphedema extends onto chest
  - Specific areas: anterior chest wall, areas beyond arm appliance coverage
  - Demonstrate standard arm appliances cannot cover affected chest areas
- **For post-mastectomy cases, detailed surgical history strengthens approval:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Mastectomy type and date
  - Chest wall involvement documented during surgery or post-operatively
  - Radiation therapy to chest (significantly increases risk)
  - Time since surgery (lymphedema can develop years later)
- **Document failed trial of arm-only treatment:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Example: "Patient tried E0651 with E0665 full arm appliance for 4 weeks. Arm edema improved from 38cm to 35cm at upper arm, but chest wall involvement persisted with chest circumference remaining 94cm. Arm appliance covers to shoulder only - chest wall lymphedema extending beyond requires E0657 chest appliance with E0652 manual control."
- **Medical necessity statement should be explicit:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - "Post-mastectomy lymphedema extends from left arm onto left anterior chest wall. Standard arm appliance (E0665) coverage ends at shoulder - cannot address chest wall involvement. E0657 chest appliance medically necessary to compress chest wall areas affected by lymphedema extending beyond arm boundaries. Manual chamber control (E0652) required for chest compression complexity and sensitivity."
- Lymphedema specialist or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation adds significant credibility *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete all E0652 requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation, unique characteristics

**Medicaid:**
- **Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering** (not DVS - full PA review for complex device) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review early: (800) 342-3005
- **Specialist evaluation highly recommended** (lymphedema specialist, certified therapist) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Comprehensive fiscal order essential:**
  - Chest measurements documented
  - Lymphedema extending onto chest wall clearly explained
  - Post-surgical history detailed (for post-mastectomy cases)
  - Medical necessity for chest compression detailed
  - Failed trials of arm-only appliances documented
  - Treatment plan with expected outcomes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- High-cost specialized device - expect rigorous review
- Strong clinical justification critical for approval
- Post-mastectomy history with chest wall involvement strengthens case *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
