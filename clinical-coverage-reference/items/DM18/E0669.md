# E0669 - Segmental Half Leg Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Below Knee, Multi-Chamber)

## Clinical Overview

E0669 is a segmented (multi-chamber) pneumatic compression appliance for below-knee compression, covering the foot, ankle, and calf with sequential compression. This appliance has multiple chambers that inflate sequentially from distal (foot) to proximal (calf), creating graduated pressure that promotes lymphatic drainage or venous return. Used for patients whose lymphedema or CVI with ulcers is limited to the below-knee region and require segmented sequential compression.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-chamber design for sequential compression
- Covers below-knee area: foot, ankle, calf (to just below knee)
- Compatible with E0651, E0652, or E0675 pumps
- Sequential inflation pattern (foot to calf)

**Coverage Criteria:**
- **Lymphedema:** Failed 4-week conservative therapy
- **CVI with Ulcers:** Failed 6-month conservative therapy
- **Must justify why segmented compression needed vs. nonsegmented (E0666)**

**CRITICAL:** Cannot be billed with E0676 DVT prevention device. Edema must be limited to below knee (if extends to thigh, use E0667 full leg).

## Coverage Details

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Should use E0666 nonsegmented instead"** - Insufficient justification for segmented compression. Fix: Must document why sequential multi-chamber compression medically necessary. Explain clinical benefits of distal-to-proximal sequential inflation for lymphatic drainage or venous return. Example: "Below-knee lymphedema requires graduated compression from foot to calf. Sequential inflation (E0669) promotes lymphatic drainage more effectively than uniform pressure (E0666). E0666 nonsegmented insufficient for complex edema pattern." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Edema extends above knee to thigh"** - Full leg involvement. Fix: E0669 only covers below knee. If edema extends to thigh, must use E0667 full leg appliance instead. Document measurements showing edema limited to calf and ankle. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"E0650 pump ordered"** - Wrong pump type. Fix: E0669 segmental appliance requires segmented pump (E0651, E0652, or E0675). Cannot be used with E0650 nonsegmented pump. For nonsegmented pumps, use E0666 appliance instead. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Pump not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0669 appliance coverage depends on pump (E0651, E0652, or E0675) approval. Ensure pump meets all NCD 280.6 criteria plus segmented pump justification. Cannot approve appliance without approved pump. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Less than required time. Fix: For lymphedema, must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial. For CVI with ulcers, must document full 6-month conservative therapy trial. Include dates, garment grade (â‰¥30mmHg below-knee), compliance, why failed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Billed with E0676"** - Incorrect combination. Fix: E0669 cannot be billed with E0676 DVT prevention device. E0669 is for lymphedema or CVI with ulcers treatment, not DVT prevention. For E0676 replacement, use A4600 only. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"CVI without ulcers"** - CVI diagnosis without ulceration. Fix: For CVI indication, venous stasis ulcers must be documented. CVI alone without ulcers not covered. Document ulcer location (calf/ankle), size, characteristics if using CVI indication. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"No justification for segmented compression"** - Missing rationale. Fix: Must explain why segmented sequential compression medically necessary. Document lymphedema or ulcer characteristics requiring graduated compression, clinical assessment showing segmented approach superior, why E0666 inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on pump (E0651, E0652, or E0675) approval first - appliance follows pump *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document below-knee edema with measurements** (ankle, calf) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Key to approval: Strong justification for segmented vs. nonsegmented:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Example: "Below-knee lymphedema with significant edema (ankle 28cm, calf 42cm). Sequential multi-chamber compression (E0669) provides graduated distal-to-proximal pressure promoting lymphatic drainage more effectively than uniform pressure (E0666). Segmented appliance medically necessary for complex edema pattern requiring graduated compression from foot to calf."
- For lymphedema: Document 4-week conservative therapy with below-knee stockings â‰¥30mmHg
- For CVI with ulcers: Document 6-month conservative therapy + ulcer characteristics in calf/ankle
- If patient tried E0666 nonsegmented and failed, document that trial *(Under Review)*
- Complete all pump requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation
- For CVI with ulcers, vascular specialist evaluation strengthens case *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Authorization pathway depends on pump type *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include E0669 specification in pump authorization request
- Fiscal order should state: "E0651 segmental compressor with E0669 segmental half leg appliance for below-knee lymphedema/CVI requiring sequential compression"
- **Measurements critical:** Document ankle and calf circumferences *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify segmented vs. nonsegmented in fiscal order:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Why E0666 insufficient
  - Clinical benefits of sequential compression
  - Expected outcomes
- For CVI with ulcers, vascular specialist evaluation strengthens approval *(Under Review)*
- Document conservative therapy specifics thoroughly
