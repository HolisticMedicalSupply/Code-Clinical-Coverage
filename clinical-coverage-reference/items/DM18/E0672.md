# E0672 - Gradient Full Arm Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Built-in Gradient)

## Clinical Overview

E0672 is a gradient pressure pneumatic appliance for full arm compression with **built-in gradient** design. The gradient (graduated pressure from hand to shoulder) is achieved through the appliance's construction rather than pump pressure variation. Used with E0650 nonsegmental pump. Hand segment included in appliance - no separate hand appliance can be billed.

**Key Features:**
- **Built-in gradient** (designed into appliance, not pump-controlled)
- Covers full arm: shoulder, upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, **hand included**
- **Used ONLY with E0650 nonsegmental pump**
- Most common: Post-mastectomy lymphedema

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Failed 4-week conservative therapy (compression â‰¥30mmHg, elevation, exercise)
- Must justify why gradient appliance needed vs. standard E0665
