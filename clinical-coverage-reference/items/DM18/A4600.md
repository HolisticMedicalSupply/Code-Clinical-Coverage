# A4600 - Replacement Sleeve for Pneumatic Compression Device

## Clinical Overview

A4600 is a **replacement-only** code for pneumatic compression device sleeves/appliances. This code is used when an existing compression sleeve is damaged beyond repair, creates complications (tourniquet effect, retrograde edema flow), or no longer fits properly. For E0676 DVT prevention devices, A4600 is the ONLY replacement code available. Cannot be billed at initial device setup - only for replacements of approved devices already on file. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL:** This is NOT an initial supply code. Patient must already have an approved pneumatic compression device (E0650, E0651, E0652, or E0676) before A4600 can be billed.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

Must meet **ALL** of the following:

1. **Existing approved device on file** - Patient already has Medicare-approved pneumatic compression device *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **Medical necessity for replacement:**
   - Existing sleeve damaged beyond repair
   - Tourniquet effect at proximal edge causing complications
   - Retrograde edema flow from improper appliance function
   - Improper fit causing skin breakdown or complications *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **For E0676 devices:** A4600 is the exclusive replacement code - no other appliance codes can be billed *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery)** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Documentation of existing approved device (date of initial approval, device code)
- **Medical necessity statement** explaining why replacement needed:
  - Describe damage (tears, holes, material breakdown)
  - Document complications (tourniquet effect, edema worsening, skin changes)
  - Document improper fit issues if applicable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Physician signature and date
- No prior authorization required for routine replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**

- Cannot be billed at initial device delivery - replacement only
- For E0676 DVT prevention devices, only A4600 can be used for replacement appliances
- Previous device approval must be documented in patient file *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Frequency limits not explicitly stated - based on medical necessity *(Under Review)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - replacement only when existing approved device on file *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Medical necessity for replacement documented

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- **Document reason for replacement:**
  - Damage description
  - Complications from existing sleeve
  - Improper fit issues *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Previous device approval must be on file with NY Medicaid
- Delivery documentation maintained
- Direct bill - no prior authorization required for replacement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**

- Previous approved device (E0650, E0651, E0652) must be documented in NY Medicaid records
- Cannot bill for initial device setup - replacement only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Same requirements as Nassau County.** Direct bill, no PA required, replacement only with previous approved device on file.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] Specific code: "A4600 - Sleeve for intermittent limb compression device, replacement only"
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (I89.0, I87.2, I97.2, etc.)
- [ ] **Previous approved device documentation:**
  - [ ] Original device code (E0650, E0651, E0652, or E0676)
  - [ ] Original approval date: _______
- [ ] **Medical necessity for replacement:**
  - [ ] Damage description (tears, material breakdown, etc.): _______
  - [ ] OR Tourniquet effect documented: _______
  - [ ] OR Retrograde edema flow documented: _______
  - [ ] OR Improper fit causing complications: _______
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] WOPD completed
- [ ] Previous device approval on file
- [ ] Medical necessity statement detailed

**For Medicaid:**
- [ ] Fiscal order comprehensive
- [ ] Previous approved device in NY Medicaid records
- [ ] Reason for replacement clearly documented

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No initial device on file"** - Cannot find previous approved pneumatic compression device. Fix: Verify patient has approved E0650, E0651, E0652, or E0676 on file. Submit documentation showing initial approval date and device code. A4600 only for replacement of existing approved devices. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Billed at initial setup"** - A4600 submitted with initial device delivery. Fix: A4600 is replacement-only code. At initial delivery, appliances are included with pump code (E0650, E0651, E0652) or as part of E0676. Do not bill A4600 at initial setup. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No medical necessity documented"** - Replacement request without explanation. Fix: Document specific reason for replacement: damage description (tears, holes, material failure), complications (tourniquet effect causing edema worsening, retrograde flow), improper fit causing skin breakdown. Include clinical observations. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Wrong code for device type"** - Attempting to bill other appliance codes for E0676 replacement. Fix: For E0676 DVT prevention devices, A4600 is the ONLY replacement code available. Do not use E0666-E0673 appliance codes with E0676. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Too soon for replacement"** - Requesting replacement shortly after initial delivery. Fix: Document exceptional circumstances requiring early replacement (rapid weight change affecting fit, unexpected damage, medical complications). Typical replacement frequency not specified in policy - justify based on medical necessity. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Verify previous device approval is documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Be specific about replacement reason** - don't just say "needs replacement," describe:
  - Exact damage (location, size, type)
  - Clinical complications observed (edema worsening, skin changes)
  - Why current appliance no longer appropriate *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- For E0676 devices, use ONLY A4600 for replacement appliances *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete WOPD before delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- Confirm previous device in NY Medicaid records before ordering *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order should reference original device approval date *(Under Review)*
- Document reason for replacement in clinical notes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Direct bill - no need to wait for PA *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
