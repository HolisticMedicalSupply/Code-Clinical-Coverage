# E0671 - Gradient Full Leg Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Built-in Gradient)

## Clinical Overview

E0671 is a gradient pressure pneumatic appliance for full leg compression with **built-in gradient** design. The gradient (graduated pressure from distal to proximal) is achieved through the appliance's construction rather than pump pressure variation. Used with E0650 nonsegmental pump, this combination is functionally equivalent to E0651 + standard segmented appliance.

**Key Features:**
- **Built-in gradient** (designed into appliance, not pump-controlled)
- Covers full leg: thigh, knee, calf, ankle, foot
- **Used ONLY with E0650 nonsegmental pump**
- Functionally equivalent to E0651 + E0667 combination

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Lymphedema: Failed 4-week conservative therapy
- Must justify why gradient pressure needed vs. standard E0660 nonsegmented appliance
