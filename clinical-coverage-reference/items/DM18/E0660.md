# E0660 - Full Leg Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Thigh to Foot)

## Clinical Overview

E0660 is a nonsegmental pneumatic compression appliance (sleeve) covering the full leg from thigh to foot. Used with E0650 nonsegmental compressor for patients with full-leg lymphedema or chronic venous insufficiency with venous stasis ulcers affecting the entire leg. This appliance provides uniform compression throughout the leg and must be designed to prevent retrograde edema flow to proximal leg.

**Key Features:**
- Covers full leg: thigh, knee, calf, ankle, foot
- Nonsegmental design (uniform compression)
- Used with E0650 compressor
- Dual indication: lymphedema OR CVI with ulcers

**Coverage Criteria:**
- **Lymphedema:** Failed 4-week conservative therapy
- **CVI with Ulcers:** Failed 6-month conservative therapy (lower extremity only)

**CRITICAL:** Coverage tied to E0650 compressor approval. Must document why full leg appliance needed vs. half leg (E0666).

## Coverage Details

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Should use E0666 half leg instead"** - Edema limited to below knee. Fix: E0660 full leg requires edema extending into thigh. If edema only in calf/ankle (below knee), use E0666 half leg appliance. Document measurements showing thigh circumference significantly increased vs. normal, demonstrating thigh involvement. Explain why full leg compression medically necessary to prevent retrograde edema flow. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No thigh measurements"** - Missing documentation of upper leg edema. Fix: Must document measurements at all four points: ankle, calf, knee, AND thigh. Thigh measurement critical to justify full leg appliance vs. half leg. Compare to contralateral limb or baseline showing thigh edema. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"E0650 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0660 appliance coverage depends on E0650 compressor approval. Ensure E0650 meets all NCD 280.6 criteria: 4-week conservative failure (lymphedema) or 6-month failure (CVI with ulcers), measurements, WOPD, F2F, financial attestation. Cannot approve appliance without approved pump. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Less than required time. Fix: For lymphedema, must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial. For CVI with ulcers, must document full 6-month conservative therapy trial. Include dates, compression stocking grade (≥30mmHg full leg), compliance, elevation/exercise protocols, why failed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"CVI without ulcers"** - CVI diagnosis without ulceration. Fix: For CVI indication, venous stasis ulcers must be documented. CVI alone without ulcers not covered. If patient has CVI without ulcers, check if lymphedema diagnosis applies instead. Document ulcer location, size, characteristics if using CVI indication. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Measurements at only one or two points"** - Incomplete measurements. Fix: Must document measurements at multiple points along entire leg: ankle, calf, knee, thigh. Single measurement insufficient. Serial measurements show edema distribution and extent justifying full leg compression. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No justification for full leg"** (Medicaid) - Missing rationale for full leg vs. half leg. Fix: Fiscal order must explain why full leg appliance medically necessary vs. half leg. Document thigh involvement, risk of retrograde edema if only below-knee compression used, clinical assessment showing full-leg compression required. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on E0650 compressor approval first - appliance follows pump *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document full-leg edema with measurements at all 4 points:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Ankle: Show edema at foot/ankle level
  - Calf: Mid-calf measurement
  - Knee: At/above knee joint
  - Thigh: Mid-thigh or upper thigh measurement showing edema extends to proximal leg
- **Key to approval: Justify full leg vs. half leg:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - "Edema extends from foot to upper thigh. Below-knee compression (E0666) would risk retrograde edema flow to uncompressed thigh region. Full leg compression (E0660) medically necessary to address entire affected limb."
- For lymphedema: Document 4-week conservative therapy with full-leg compression stockings ≥30mmHg
- For CVI: Document 6-month conservative therapy + ulcer presence/characteristics
- Compare measurements to contralateral limb or baseline showing progression *(Under Review)*
- Complete all E0650 requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation

**Medicaid:**
- Include E0660 specification in E0650 DVS authorization request *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order should state: "E0650 nonsegmental compressor with E0660 full leg appliance for full-leg lymphedema/CVI with ulcers"
- **Measurements critical:** Document all 4 points (ankle, calf, knee, thigh) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify full leg vs. half leg in fiscal order:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Explain thigh involvement
  - Clinical necessity for full-leg compression
  - Why E0666 below-knee insufficient
- For CVI with ulcers, vascular specialist evaluation strengthens approval *(Under Review)*
- DVS authorization covers pump and appliance together *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
