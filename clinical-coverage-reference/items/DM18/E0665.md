# E0665 - Full Arm Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Shoulder to Hand)

## Clinical Overview

E0665 is a nonsegmental pneumatic compression appliance (sleeve) covering the full arm from shoulder to hand. Used with E0650 nonsegmental compressor for patients with full-arm lymphedema extending from hand to shoulder. Most commonly prescribed for post-mastectomy lymphedema with axillary lymph node dissection or post-surgical upper extremity lymphedema affecting the entire arm.

**Key Features:**
- Covers full arm: shoulder, upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand
- Nonsegmental design (uniform compression)
- Used with E0650 compressor
- Most common indication: Post-mastectomy lymphedema with axillary node dissection

**Coverage Criteria:**
- **Lymphedema:** Failed 4-week conservative therapy (compression garments ≥30mmHg, exercise, elevation)

**CRITICAL:** Coverage tied to E0650 compressor approval. Must document full arm involvement from shoulder to hand.

## Coverage Details

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Lymphedema limited to below elbow"** - Edema only in forearm/hand. Fix: E0665 full arm requires lymphedema extending to upper arm/shoulder. If edema limited to below elbow (forearm and hand), use E0655 half arm appliance instead. Document measurements showing upper arm circumference significantly increased, demonstrating upper arm involvement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No upper arm measurements"** - Missing documentation of upper arm edema. Fix: Must document measurements at all four points: wrist, forearm, elbow, AND upper arm. Upper arm measurement critical to justify full arm appliance vs. half arm. Compare to contralateral limb or baseline showing upper arm edema. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"E0650 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0665 appliance coverage depends on E0650 compressor approval. Ensure E0650 meets all NCD 280.6 criteria: 4-week conservative failure, measurements, WOPD, F2F, financial attestation. Cannot approve appliance without approved pump. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Less than 4 weeks documented. Fix: Must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial. Include start/end dates, compression garment grade (≥30mmHg full arm sleeve), compliance notes (wore daily), exercises performed (type/frequency), elevation protocol followed. Explain why conservative therapy failed (e.g., "Edema increased despite 4 weeks daily 30mmHg compression"). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No post-surgical history"** - Missing mastectomy/surgical details for post-mastectomy lymphedema. Fix: For post-mastectomy lymphedema, document mastectomy date, axillary lymph node dissection (number of nodes removed), radiation therapy if received. Surgical details support medical necessity. Not required for all cases but strengthens approval for post-mastectomy indication. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Garment type/grade not specified"** - Vague conservative therapy documentation. Fix: Must specify exact garment type ("full arm compression sleeve") and pressure grade ("30-40mmHg"). Include wearing schedule ("worn daily for 4 weeks") and compliance. Generic statements like "tried compression" insufficient. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"Measurements at only one or two points"** - Incomplete measurements. Fix: Must document measurements at multiple points along entire arm: wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm. Single measurement insufficient. Serial measurements show edema distribution and extent justifying full arm compression. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Missing financial attestation"** (Medicare) - No prescriber financial disclosure. Fix: Prescriber must sign attestation that they have no financial relationship with DME supplier. Required Medicare fraud prevention measure. Include with WOPD.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on E0650 compressor approval first - appliance follows pump *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document full-arm edema with measurements at all 4 points:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Wrist: Show hand/wrist edema
  - Forearm: Mid-forearm measurement
  - Elbow: At elbow joint
  - Upper arm: Mid-bicep or upper arm measurement showing edema extends to proximal arm
- **For post-mastectomy lymphedema, include surgical details:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Mastectomy date
  - Axillary lymph node dissection (number of nodes)
  - Radiation therapy (increases lymphedema risk)
  - Time since surgery (lymphedema can develop years later)
- **Conservative therapy documentation should be specific:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - "Patient wore 30-40mmHg full arm compression sleeve daily for 4 weeks (6/1/2025 - 6/29/2025)"
  - "Performed manual lymphatic drainage exercises 2x daily"
  - "Elevated arm above heart level 3x daily for 15 minutes"
  - "Despite compliance, arm circumference increased from 32cm to 35cm at upper arm"
- Compare measurements to contralateral arm showing asymmetry *(Under Review)*
- Complete all E0650 requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation
- Face-to-face encounter should document arm examination

**Medicaid:**
- Include E0665 specification in E0650 DVS authorization request *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order should state: "E0650 nonsegmental compressor with E0665 full arm appliance for post-mastectomy lymphedema" (or appropriate indication)
- **Measurements critical:** Document all 4 points (wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **For post-mastectomy cases, include surgical history:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Enhances clinical justification
  - Explains etiology of lymphedema
  - Supports medical necessity
- Lymphedema specialist or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation strengthens approval *(Under Review)*
- Document conservative therapy specifics: garment grade, compliance, exercises, elevation
- DVS authorization covers pump and appliance together *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
