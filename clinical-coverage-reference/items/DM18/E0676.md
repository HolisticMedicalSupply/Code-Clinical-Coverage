# E0676 - DVT Prevention Pneumatic Compression Device (All-Inclusive System)

## ðŸš¨ NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE (Statutory Exclusion)

## Clinical Overview

E0676 is an all-inclusive intermittent limb compression device system for **DVT prevention only** (prophylactic use in hospitalized/immobilized patients). This is **NOT** for treatment of lymphedema, venous insufficiency, or existing conditions - it is strictly for **prevention** of deep venous thrombosis.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE (STATUTORY EXCLUSION)**

**Key Features:**
- **All-inclusive system:** pump, appliances, accessories bundled
- **DVT prevention ONLY** - prophylactic use
- **NOT** for treatment of lymphedema, CVI, or existing conditions
- Typically used in institutional settings (hospitals, nursing facilities)

**Medicare Coverage Status:**
- **NOT COVERED** - preventive services **statutorily excluded** from DME benefit per Social Security Act Â§1861(s)(6)
- All claims DENIED - no appeals pathway

**NY Medicaid Coverage Status:**
- **NOT covered for home DME**
- May be covered in **institutional settings only** (hospitals, nursing facilities)
- Not listed in home DME manual *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Status

**NOT COVERED** - Medicare does not cover E0676 due to statutory exclusion.

**Rationale:**
- **Preventive services statutorily excluded** from DME benefit per Social Security Act Â§1861(s)(6)
- E0676 is for DVT **prevention** (not treatment)
- Medicare **DENIES** all E0676 claims as preventive service with no Medicare DME benefit category
- This is a **statutory exclusion** - not policy-based, no appeals pathway

**Billing Restrictions:**
- **All-inclusive code:** pump, appliances, accessories bundled
- **CANNOT bill E0666-E0673 separately** with E0676
- **Replacement appliances:** Use A4600 ONLY (no other replacement codes allowed)

**Important Notes:**
- Do NOT prescribe E0676 for home use expecting Medicare coverage
- Medicare will deny all claims (statutory exclusion)
- For **treatment** of lymphedema/CVI: use E0650/E0651/E0652 with appropriate appliances (E0655-E0673)
- Billing E0650/E0651/E0652 for DVT prevention is fraud

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Coverage Status: NOT COVERED FOR HOME DME**

**Current Status:**
- **May be covered in INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS ONLY** (hospitals, nursing facilities)
- **NOT** typically covered for home DME use
- **Not listed** in home DME manual *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Institutional Coverage:**
- May be covered for hospitals, nursing facilities *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Contact NY Medicaid institutional billing for coverage determination
- Different billing process than home DME
- Facility-based billing *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Home DME:**
- **DO NOT order E0676 for home use expecting Medicaid coverage**
- Not in home DME manual
- Likely denial for home use *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Important Notes:**
- For **treatment** of lymphedema/CVI at home: use E0650/E0651/E0652 + appliances
- E0676 is prevention-only device
- Institutional vs. home coverage pathways completely different *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Before Prescribing:**
- [ ] **Understand E0676 is NOT COVERED by Medicare (statutory exclusion)**
- [ ] **Understand E0676 is NOT covered by NY Medicaid for HOME DME**
- [ ] **Determine if patient in institutional setting** (hospital, nursing facility)
- [ ] **For home use: DO NOT PRESCRIBE expecting coverage**
- [ ] **Inform patient of non-coverage for home use and full financial responsibility**

**For Institutional Settings (Hospital/Nursing Facility ONLY):**
- [ ] Verify facility coverage through NY Medicaid institutional billing
- [ ] Facility-based billing (not home DME)
- [ ] DVT prevention indication documented
- [ ] Patient immobilized/hospitalized
- [ ] Prophylactic use only - NOT treatment *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**If Ordering for Home Use (Patient Self-Pay):**
- [ ] **Patient informed consent/acknowledgment:**
  - [ ] NOT COVERED by Medicare (statutory exclusion)
  - [ ] NOT COVERED by NY Medicaid for home use
  - [ ] Patient responsible for full cost
  - [ ] Patient signature acknowledging financial responsibility
- [ ] Patient demographics
- [ ] **Device code: "E0676 - Intermittent limb compression device, DVT prevention"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (DVT risk/prevention)
- [ ] DVT risk factors documented
- [ ] Why prophylactic compression needed
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**Clinical Distinction - Treatment vs. Prevention:**
- [ ] **Prevention (E0676):** NOT COVERED for home use - use in institutional settings only
- [ ] **Treatment (E0650/E0651/E0652):** COVERED for lymphedema/CVI - use for home treatment

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Preventive service - statutory exclusion Â§1861(s)(6)"** - Medicare statutory exclusion. Fix: E0676 is STATUTORILY EXCLUDED from Medicare DME benefit per Social Security Act Â§1861(s)(6). Cannot appeal statutory exclusion. For **treatment** of lymphedema/CVI, use E0650/E0651/E0652 + appliances (E0655-E0673).

2. **"Not covered for home DME use"** - Medicaid home DME exclusion. Fix: E0676 may be covered in **institutional settings only** (hospitals, nursing facilities). NOT covered for home DME by NY Medicaid. Contact NY Medicaid institutional billing for facility coverage. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"All-inclusive code - separate appliance billing denied"** - Billing error. Fix: E0676 is all-inclusive system (pump, appliances, accessories bundled). CANNOT bill E0666-E0673 separately with E0676. For replacement appliances, use A4600 ONLY.

4. **"Device for prevention not treatment"** - Indication mismatch. Fix: E0676 is for DVT **prevention** only (prophylactic), NOT for **treatment** of existing lymphedema/CVI. For treatment, use appropriate covered codes: E0650/E0651/E0652 + appliances.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **DO NOT prescribe E0676 for home use expecting Medicare coverage**
- Statutory exclusion - no appeals pathway
- For **treatment** of lymphedema/CVI: use E0650/E0651/E0652 + appliances
- **NEVER** bill treatment codes (E0650/E0651/E0652) for DVT prevention - this is fraud

**Medicaid:**
- **Home DME: NOT COVERED** - do not prescribe for home use
- **Institutional settings:** May be covered (hospitals, nursing facilities) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Contact NY Medicaid institutional billing for facility coverage
- For home **treatment** of lymphedema/CVI: use E0650/E0651/E0652 + appliances

**Critical Clinical Distinction:**

| Indication | Code | Medicare | NY Medicaid Home DME |
|------------|------|----------|---------------------|
| **Prevention** (DVT prophylaxis) | E0676 | NOT COVERED | NOT COVERED |
| **Treatment** (lymphedema/CVI) | E0650/E0651/E0652 + appliances | COVERED | COVERED |

**Billing Restrictions:**
- E0676 is **all-inclusive** - cannot bill appliances (E0666-E0673) separately
- Replacement appliances: **A4600 ONLY**
- Do NOT mix E0676 with treatment codes
