# E0667 - Segmental Full Leg Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Multi-Chamber)

## Clinical Overview

E0667 is a segmented (multi-chamber) pneumatic compression appliance for full leg compression, providing sequential compression from foot to thigh. This appliance has multiple chambers that inflate sequentially in a distal-to-proximal pattern, creating a wave-like compression effect that promotes lymphatic drainage or venous return. Used with E0651 or E0652 segmental pumps for patients requiring sequential compression rather than uniform pressure.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-chamber design for sequential compression
- Covers full leg: thigh, knee, calf, ankle, foot
- Used with E0651 or E0652 pumps (NOT E0650 nonsegmental)
- Sequential inflation pattern (distal to proximal)

**Coverage Criteria:**
- **Lymphedema:** Failed 4-week conservative therapy
- **CVI with Ulcers:** Failed 6-month conservative therapy (lower extremity only)
- **Must justify why segmented compression needed vs. nonsegmented (E0660)**

**CRITICAL:** Cannot be billed with E0676 DVT prevention devices. Must document why sequential compression medically necessary.

## Coverage Details

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Should use E0660 nonsegmented instead"** - Insufficient justification for segmented compression. Fix: Must document why sequential multi-chamber compression medically necessary vs. uniform pressure (E0660). Explain clinical benefits of distal-to-proximal sequential inflation for lymphedema or venous return. Examples: "Lymphedema severity requires graduated compression from ankle to thigh. Sequential inflation promotes lymphatic drainage more effectively than uniform pressure. E0660 nonsegmented insufficient for complex edema pattern." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"E0650 pump ordered"** - Wrong pump type. Fix: E0667 segmental appliance requires segmented pump (E0651 or E0652). Cannot be used with E0650 nonsegmented pump. For nonsegmented pumps, use E0660 appliance instead. Specify E0651 or E0652 pump with E0667 appliance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"E0651/E0652 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0667 appliance coverage depends on segmented pump (E0651 or E0652) approval. Ensure pump meets all NCD 280.6 criteria plus segmented pump justification. Cannot approve appliance without approved pump. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No justification for segmented compression"** - Missing rationale. Fix: Must explain why segmented sequential compression medically necessary. Document lymphedema severity, complex edema pattern requiring graduated compression, clinical assessment showing segmented approach superior. Compare to failed nonsegmented compression attempt if applicable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Less than required time. Fix: For lymphedema, must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial. For CVI with ulcers, must document full 6-month conservative therapy trial. Include dates, garment grade (≥30mmHg full leg), compliance, why failed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Billed with E0676"** - Incorrect combination. Fix: E0667 cannot be billed with E0676 DVT prevention device. E0667 is for lymphedema or CVI with ulcers treatment, not DVT prevention. For DVT prevention device replacement, use A4600 only. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No measurements at multiple points"** - Incomplete measurements. Fix: Must document measurements at all four points (ankle, calf, knee, thigh) showing full leg edema. Multiple measurements establish severity and extent justifying segmented compression. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on segmented pump (E0651 or E0652) approval first - appliance follows pump *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document full-leg edema with measurements at all 4 points** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Key to approval: Strong justification for segmented vs. nonsegmented:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Example: "Patient's full leg lymphedema extends from foot to upper thigh with significant edema throughout (ankle 28cm, calf 42cm, knee 46cm, thigh 58cm). Sequential multi-chamber compression (E0667) provides graduated distal-to-proximal pressure promoting lymphatic drainage more effectively than uniform pressure (E0660). Segmented appliance medically necessary for complex edema pattern requiring graduated compression gradient."
- For lymphedema: Document 4-week conservative therapy with full leg stockings ≥30mmHg
- For CVI: Document 6-month conservative therapy + ulcer characteristics
- If patient tried E0660 nonsegmented and failed, document that trial *(Under Review)*
- Complete all pump requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation
- Vascular or lymphedema specialist evaluation strengthens case *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Authorization pathway depends on pump type: *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - E0651 + E0667: DVS authorization (simplified since October 2025)
  - E0652 + E0667: Prior approval (more stringent)
- Include E0667 specification in pump authorization request
- Fiscal order should state: "E0651 segmental compressor with E0667 segmental full leg appliance for full leg lymphedema/CVI requiring sequential compression"
- **Measurements critical:** Document all 4 points (ankle, calf, knee, thigh) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Justify segmented vs. nonsegmented in fiscal order:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Why E0660 insufficient
  - Clinical benefits of sequential compression
  - Lymphedema characteristics requiring segmented approach
- For CVI with ulcers, vascular specialist evaluation strengthens approval *(Under Review)*
- Document conservative therapy specifics thoroughly
