# E0652 - Segmental Pneumatic Compression Pump with Manual Chamber Control

## Clinical Overview

E0652 is the highest-tier segmental pneumatic compression pump with calibrated gradient pressure control, allowing manual adjustment of individual chamber pressures. This advanced pump is **ONLY covered when patient has unique characteristics** preventing satisfactory treatment with nonsegmented (E0650) or standard segmented (E0651) devices.

**Typical Indications:**
- Lymphedema extending to chest/trunk/abdomen beyond standard sleeve limits
- Complex anatomical considerations requiring individualized chamber pressure titration
- Failed trial of E0650 or E0651 with proper conservative therapy (4+ weeks daily use) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Key Feature:** Prescriber can manually adjust pressure in each individual chamber to customize compression gradient based on patient's specific anatomy and edema pattern.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL:** This is NOT a first-line device. Must document unique patient characteristics and typically failed trials of less complex pumps (E0650/E0651) before E0652 will be approved.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

Must meet **ALL** of the following:

1. **Basic lymphedema or CVI criteria** (same as E0650/E0651):
   - Lymphedema with failed 4-week conservative therapy (compression garments â‰¥30mmHg, elevation, exercise)
   - OR CVI with venous stasis ulcers with failed 6-month conservative therapy
   - Objective measurements documenting edema

2. **Unique patient characteristics** requiring manual chamber control:

   **Most Common Justifications:**
   - **Lymphedema extending to trunk/abdomen** beyond standard limb sleeve limits - measurements showing trunk involvement *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
   - **Lymphedema extending to chest** (post-mastectomy with chest wall involvement) requiring chest appliance with manual control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
   - **Complex anatomy** requiring individualized pressure titration not achievable with predetermined gradient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
   - **Failed trial of E0650 or E0651** with proper fitting and daily use (typically 4+ weeks documented) showing inadequate edema response *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **Documented failed trials** of less complex devices:
   - Trial of E0650 nonsegmental pump - dates, compliance, inadequate response documented *(Under Review)*
   - OR trial of E0651 segmented pump - dates, compliance, inadequate response documented *(Under Review)*
   - Typically 4+ weeks daily use with proper fitting required before declaring failure *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Highest documentation level required:**
- **WOPD (Written Order Prior to Delivery) mandatory** before device dispensed
- **Face-to-face encounter documented**
- **Financial attestation required** (prescriber no financial relationship with DME supplier)
- **Comprehensive documentation package:**
  - Diagnosis and prognosis with objective measurements at multiple points
  - **Unique patient characteristics** requiring manual chamber control:
    - Measurements showing trunk/chest involvement beyond limb boundaries
    - Complex anatomical considerations documented
    - Why predetermined gradient (E0651) insufficient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - **Failed conservative therapy:** 4 weeks lymphedema (compression garments â‰¥30mmHg, elevation, exercise) OR 6 months CVI with ulcers
  - **Failed trial documentation:**
    - E0650 or E0651 device trial dates (typically 4+ weeks)
    - Proper fitting confirmed (no tourniquet effect, appropriate limb coverage)
    - Daily use compliance documented
    - Inadequate edema response shown (measurements comparing pre-trial vs. post-trial) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Treatment plan explaining why manual chamber control necessary
  - Clinical response expectations with E0652 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Physician signature and date
- Ordering provider NPI number

**Important Notes:**

- Manual chamber control allows prescriber to adjust individual chamber pressures
- Typically used with complex appliances: E0656 (trunk), E0657 (chest), E0658 (two arms + chest), E0659 (head + neck + chest), E0670 (two legs + trunk)
- Can also be used with standard segmented appliances (E0667, E0668, E0669) when unique characteristics require manual control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No prior authorization required by Medicare, but highest documentation burden *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - lymphedema with unique characteristics requiring manual chamber control
- Failed trials of E0650 or E0651 typically required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Trunk/chest involvement OR complex anatomy requiring individualized pressure

**Documentation Requirements:**

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"No unique characteristics documented"** - E0652 ordered without justification for highest-tier device. Fix: Must document unique patient characteristics: lymphedema extending to trunk/chest beyond standard sleeve limits (with measurements), complex anatomy requiring individualized pressure titration, or documented failed trials of E0650/E0651. E0652 NOT appropriate as first-line device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Should use E0650 or E0651 instead"** - Insufficient justification for manual chamber control. Fix: Document why predetermined gradient insufficient. Most common justifications: trunk/chest involvement requiring specialized appliances (E0656, E0657), complex edema pattern across multiple body regions, failed trial of less complex pump showing inadequate response despite proper fitting and compliance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No failed trial documented"** - E0652 requested as first device. Fix: Typically must document trial of E0650 or E0651 first. Trial should be 4+ weeks with daily use, proper fitting confirmed, compliance documented. Show inadequate edema response with measurements (e.g., "After 4-week trial of E0651 with daily use, thigh circumference decreased only 1cm from 52cm to 51cm, insufficient progress with lymphedema extending to trunk requiring E0652 with trunk appliance"). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Trunk/chest involvement not documented"** - No measurements showing lymphedema beyond limb. Fix: If claiming trunk or chest involvement, must provide measurements documenting edema in those areas. Trunk measurements (waist, abdomen), chest measurements (chest wall), showing lymphedema extending beyond standard limb appliance coverage. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Conservative therapy trial insufficient"** - Missing or incomplete conservative therapy documentation. Fix: Same as E0650/E0651 - must document full 4-week trial (lymphedema) or 6-month trial (CVI) with compression garments â‰¥30mmHg, elevation, exercise. Include dates, compliance, why failed.

6. **"Missing financial attestation"** (Medicare) - No prescriber financial disclosure. Fix: Include financial attestation with WOPD stating no financial relationship with DME supplier.

7. **"No specialist evaluation"** (Medicaid) - Complex device without specialist input. Fix: Medicaid PA strengthened by vascular surgeon or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation documenting unique characteristics and need for highest-tier device. Not explicitly required but greatly strengthens approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Failed trial not long enough"** - E0650/E0651 trial too brief. Fix: Typically need 4+ weeks daily use with proper fitting before declaring device inadequate. Document trial duration, daily compliance, proper fitting confirmed (no tourniquet effect), inadequate edema response despite adherence. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **This is the highest-tier pump - strongest documentation required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Meet all basic E0650 requirements first (conservative therapy failure, measurements, WOPD, F2F, financial attestation)
- **Key to approval: Document unique patient characteristics** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - **Best case scenarios:**
    - Post-mastectomy lymphedema extending to chest wall requiring E0657 chest appliance with manual chamber control
    - Bilateral leg lymphedema with trunk involvement requiring E0670 integrated appliance with manual pressure titration
    - Complex anatomy (obesity, tissue irregularities) preventing adequate compression with predetermined gradient
- **Document failed trial of less complex device** (E0650 or E0651): *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Specific dates (e.g., "4/1/2025 - 4/29/2025")
  - Proper fitting confirmed (no tourniquet effect, appropriate coverage)
  - Daily compliance documented (patient wore daily as prescribed)
  - Inadequate response with measurements (e.g., "Arm circumference decreased only 0.5cm from 38cm to 37.5cm despite 4 weeks proper use, insufficient for lymphedema extending to chest")
- **Measurements showing trunk/chest involvement** strengthen case significantly *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Vascular surgeon or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation adds credibility *(Under Review)*
- Explain why manual chamber control necessary vs. predetermined gradient *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering** (not DVS - full PA review) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review early: (800) 342-3005
- **Comprehensive fiscal order essential:**
  - Unique patient characteristics detailed
  - Trunk/chest measurements if involvement documented
  - Failed trials of E0650/E0651 with dates, compliance, inadequate response
  - Treatment plan explaining manual chamber control necessity *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Specialist evaluation highly recommended** (vascular surgeon, certified lymphedema therapist) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- High-cost device - expect rigorous review
- Document complex appliance need (E0656 trunk, E0657 chest, etc.)
