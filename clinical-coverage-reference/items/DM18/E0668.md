# E0668 - Segmental Full Arm Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Multi-Chamber)

## Clinical Overview

E0668 is a segmented (multi-chamber) pneumatic compression appliance for full arm compression, providing sequential compression from hand to shoulder. Most commonly prescribed for post-mastectomy lymphedema with axillary lymph node dissection, especially when complicated by hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, elephantiasis deformity, or skin breakdown with lymphorrhea. The multi-chamber design provides sequential distal-to-proximal compression promoting lymphatic drainage more effectively than uniform pressure.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-chamber design for sequential compression
- Covers full arm: shoulder, upper arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand
- Used with E0651 or E0652 segmental pumps (NOT E0650)
- Sequential inflation pattern (hand to shoulder)

**Common Indications:**
- Post-mastectomy lymphedema with axillary node dissection
- Post-radiation therapy lymphedema
- Trauma-related lymphedema
- **Complications:** hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, elephantiasis, lymphorrhea

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Failed 4-week conservative therapy (compression â‰¥30mmHg, elevation, exercise)
- Measurements over time showing persistent/progressive lymphedema

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Should use E0665 nonsegmented instead"** - Insufficient justification for segmented compression. Fix: Must document why sequential multi-chamber compression medically necessary. Explain clinical benefits of distal-to-proximal sequential inflation for lymphatic drainage. Examples: "Post-mastectomy lymphedema with severe edema from hand to shoulder complicated by hyperkeratosis. Sequential compression (E0668) provides graduated pressure from distal to proximal promoting lymphatic drainage more effectively than uniform pressure (E0665). E0665 nonsegmented insufficient for complex lymphedema with complications." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"E0650 pump ordered"** - Wrong pump type. Fix: E0668 segmental appliance requires segmented pump (E0651 or E0652). Cannot be used with E0650 nonsegmental pump. For nonsegmental pumps, use E0665 appliance instead. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"E0651/E0652 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0668 appliance coverage depends on segmented pump approval. Ensure pump meets all NCD 280.6 criteria plus segmented pump justification. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No measurements over time"** - Only single measurement provided. Fix: Must document measurements at two time points: (1) baseline/initial measurements, (2) follow-up measurements after conservative therapy trial. Show persistence or progression of lymphedema despite conservative measures. Example: "Initial measurement 6/1/2025: upper arm 38cm. After 4-week conservative therapy 6/29/2025: upper arm 39cm, demonstrating progression despite compression garment use." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Less than 4 weeks or incomplete. Fix: Must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial including: (1) compression garment minimum 30mmHg at wrist, worn daily, (2) elevation protocol with frequency/duration, (3) exercise regimen with type/frequency. Include dates and compliance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Compression garment grade <30mmHg"** - Inadequate pressure. Fix: Conservative therapy must include compression garment with minimum 30mmHg distally (at wrist/hand area). Document specific pressure grade (e.g., "30-40mmHg full arm compression sleeve"). Lower pressures may not meet coverage criteria. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No post-surgical history"** - Missing mastectomy/surgical details. Fix: For post-mastectomy lymphedema, document mastectomy date, axillary lymph node dissection (number of nodes), radiation therapy if received. Surgical history supports medical necessity and explains etiology. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Missing financial attestation"** (Medicare) - No prescriber financial disclosure. Fix: Treating practitioner must attest to no financial relationship with DME supplier. Required Medicare fraud prevention measure. Include with WOPD. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on segmented pump (E0651 or E0652) approval first - appliance follows pump *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Measurements over time are critical:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Baseline measurements: Document initial lymphedema severity
  - Post-conservative therapy measurements: Show persistence/progression
  - Demonstrate conservative therapy inadequate despite compliance
- **For post-mastectomy lymphedema, detailed surgical history strengthens case:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Mastectomy type and date
  - Axillary lymph node dissection (number of nodes - higher number increases risk)
  - Radiation therapy (increases lymphedema risk significantly)
  - Time since surgery (lymphedema can develop years later)
- **Document complications if present:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, elephantiasis, lymphorrhea
  - Complications demonstrate severity and need for advanced treatment
  - Photograph documentation helpful (not required)
- **Conservative therapy must be specific:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - "Patient wore 30-40mmHg full arm compression sleeve daily for 4 weeks (6/1-6/29/2025)"
  - "Performed manual lymphatic drainage exercises 2x daily"
  - "Elevated arm above heart 3x daily for 15 minutes"
  - "Despite compliance, upper arm increased from 38cm to 39cm"
- **Justify segmented vs. nonsegmented clearly**
- Complete all pump requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation
- Lymphedema specialist or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation adds credibility *(Under Review)*

**Medicaid:**
- Authorization pathway depends on pump: *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - E0651 + E0668: DVS authorization (simplified since October 2025)
  - E0652 + E0668: Prior approval (if unique characteristics present)
- Include E0668 specification in pump authorization request
- Fiscal order should state: "E0651 segmental compressor with E0668 segmental full arm appliance for post-mastectomy lymphedema with complications"
- **Post-surgical history detailed:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Enhances clinical justification
  - Explains lymphedema etiology
  - Supports medical necessity
- **Document complications:** Hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis strengthen approval *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Measurements over time showing progression
- Lymphedema specialist evaluation recommended for complex cases *(Under Review)*
