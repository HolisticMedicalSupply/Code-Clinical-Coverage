# E0673 - Gradient Half Leg Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Built-in Gradient)

## Clinical Overview

E0673 is a gradient pressure pneumatic appliance for below-knee compression with **built-in gradient** design. The gradient (graduated pressure from foot to calf) is achieved through the appliance's construction rather than pump pressure variation. Used with E0650 nonsegmental pump, this combination is functionally equivalent to E0651 + E0669 combination.

**Key Features:**
- **Built-in gradient** (designed into appliance, not pump-controlled)
- Covers below-knee: foot, ankle, calf
- **Used ONLY with E0650 nonsegmental pump**
- Functionally equivalent to E0651 + E0669 combination

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Lymphedema: Failed 4-week conservative therapy
- CVI with ulcers: Failed 6-month conservative therapy
- Must justify why gradient appliance needed vs. standard E0666
