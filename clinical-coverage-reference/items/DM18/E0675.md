# E0675 - High-Pressure Pneumatic Device for Arterial Insufficiency

## ðŸš¨ NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE

## Clinical Overview

E0675 is a high-pressure, rapid inflation/deflation cycle pneumatic compression device designed for **arterial insufficiency** treatment (peripheral artery disease, chronic limb ischemia). This device is fundamentally different from lymphedema/CVI compression devices (E0650/E0651/E0652) - it uses high pressure and rapid cycles to treat arterial disease rather than venous/lymphatic conditions.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE**

**Key Features:**
- **High-pressure** rapid-cycle pneumatic pump
- Designed for **arterial disease** (PAD, arterial insufficiency, chronic limb ischemia)
- **NOT** for lymphedema or venous insufficiency
- Unilateral or bilateral system

**Medicare Coverage Status:**
- **NOT COVERED** per NCD 280.6
- Insufficient evidence supporting effectiveness/safety for arterial disease
- All claims DENIED as non-covered service

**NY Medicaid Coverage Status:**
- **UNCLEAR** - not listed in DME manual
- Requires case-by-case review
- May follow Medicare non-coverage policy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Status

**NOT COVERED** - Medicare does not cover E0675 per NCD 280.6.

**Rationale:**
- Pneumatic compression devices for peripheral artery disease (PAD) / arterial insufficiency treatment are "not reasonable and necessary"
- **Insufficient evidence** supporting effectiveness and safety for arterial disease
- Medicare **DENIES** all E0675 claims as non-covered service

**Important Notes:**
- Do NOT prescribe E0675 expecting Medicare coverage
- Medicare will deny all claims
- Patient would be responsible for full cost if device ordered

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Coverage Status: UNCLEAR**

**Current Status:**
- **Not explicitly listed** in current NY Medicaid DME manual
- **No clear coverage pathway**
- May follow Medicare non-coverage policy *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Before Prescribing:**
- **CONTACT Bureau of Medical Review BEFORE ordering: (800) 342-3005**
- Request case-by-case coverage determination
- Be prepared for likely denial following Medicare policy
- Inform patient of uncertain coverage and potential full financial responsibility

**Important Notes:**
- No established coverage pathway
- Case-by-case review required
- Likely denial following Medicare
- Patient financial responsibility likely *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Before Prescribing:**
- [ ] **Understand E0675 is NOT COVERED by Medicare**
- [ ] **For Medicaid: Contact Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005) BEFORE ordering**
- [ ] **Inform patient of non-coverage and full financial responsibility**
- [ ] Document patient acknowledgment of non-coverage/financial responsibility
- [ ] Consider alternative treatments covered by Medicare/Medicaid

**If Proceeding Despite Non-Coverage:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Device code: "E0675 - Pneumatic compression device, high pressure, arterial insufficiency"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis code (I70.xxx, I73.9)
- [ ] **Arterial insufficiency documentation:**
  - [ ] PAD diagnosis with ABI (ankle-brachial index) results
  - [ ] Arterial insufficiency severity
  - [ ] Chronic limb ischemia stage if applicable
- [ ] Conservative therapy attempts documented
- [ ] Why device medically necessary despite non-coverage
- [ ] **Patient informed consent/acknowledgment:**
  - [ ] NOT COVERED by Medicare
  - [ ] Medicaid coverage uncertain
  - [ ] Patient responsible for full cost
  - [ ] Patient signature acknowledging financial responsibility
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"NOT COVERED - NCD 280.6"** - Medicare non-coverage policy. Fix: E0675 is NOT COVERED by Medicare per NCD 280.6. Cannot appeal non-coverage policy. Patient responsible for full cost. Consider alternative covered treatments.

2. **"Insufficient evidence for arterial disease treatment"** - Evidence-based exclusion. Fix: Medicare policy explicitly excludes pneumatic compression for arterial disease due to insufficient evidence of effectiveness/safety. No documentation will overcome non-coverage policy.

3. **"Not listed in Medicaid DME manual"** - No coverage pathway. Fix: E0675 not in NY Medicaid DME manual. Requires case-by-case Bureau of Medical Review determination. Contact (800-342-3005) before ordering. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **DO NOT prescribe E0675 expecting Medicare coverage**
- Device is NOT COVERED - all claims denied
- No appeals pathway for non-coverage policy
- Patient 100% financially responsible

**Medicaid:**
- **Contact Bureau of Medical Review BEFORE ordering: (800) 342-3005** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- No established coverage pathway
- May follow Medicare non-coverage
- Likely denial
- Patient financial responsibility likely

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Consider covered treatments for arterial insufficiency (medications, revascularization)
- For venous/lymphatic conditions: use covered pneumatic devices (E0650/E0651/E0652)
- **DO NOT** attempt to bill covered codes (E0650/E0651/E0652) for arterial insufficiency - this is fraud
