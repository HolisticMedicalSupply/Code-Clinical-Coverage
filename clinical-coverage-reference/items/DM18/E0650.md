# E0650 - Nonsegmental Pneumatic Compression Pump

## Clinical Overview

E0650 is a nonsegmental (single-chamber) pneumatic compression pump used for home treatment of lymphedema or chronic venous insufficiency with ulcers. This is the most basic compression pump with a single outflow port providing uniform pressure throughout the appliance. Used after documented failure of conservative therapy (4 weeks for lymphedema, 6 months for CVI with ulcers).

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL UPDATE (November 14, 2024):** Medicare LCD L33829 has been RETIRED. Coverage now follows National Coverage Determination (NCD 280.6) exclusively, removing many restrictive local requirements and simplifying approval process.

**Coverage Criteria Summary:**
- **Lymphedema:** Failed 4-week conservative therapy (compression garments â‰¥30mmHg worn daily, elevation exercises, limb elevation)
- **CVI with Ulcers:** Failed 6-month conservative therapy (lower extremity only)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

Must meet **ONE** of the following:

**Option 1: Lymphedema (Primary or Secondary)**
1. **Diagnosis of lymphedema** - Primary or secondary lymphedema confirmed
2. **Failed 4-week conservative therapy trial** including ALL:
   - Compression garments â‰¥30mmHg worn daily (document compliance)
   - Elevation exercises performed (document frequency)
   - Limb elevation protocol (document compliance) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Objective measurements** - Limb measurements at multiple points documenting edema
4. **Conservative therapy dates documented** - Start and end dates of 4-week trial with compliance notes

**Option 2: Chronic Venous Insufficiency with Ulcers**
1. **Diagnosis of CVI with venous stasis ulcers** - Lower extremity only
2. **Failed 6-month conservative therapy trial** including compression, wound care, elevation
3. **Ulcer documentation** - Location, size, characteristics
4. **Lower extremity only** - CVI with ulcers coverage limited to legs

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) required** before device dispensed
- **Face-to-face encounter documented** within appropriate timeframe *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Comprehensive documentation including:**
  - Diagnosis and prognosis
  - Symptoms with objective measurements (limb circumferences at multiple points)
  - Detailed failed conservative treatments:
    - Specific garment type/grade (must be â‰¥30mmHg)
    - Dates of conservative therapy (4 weeks lymphedema, 6 months CVI)
    - Compliance documentation (wore garments daily, performed exercises)
  - Clinical response expectations *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Financial attestation required** - Prescriber must attest to no financial relationship with DME supplier
- Physician signature and date
- No prior authorization required if meets NCD 280.6 criteria

**Important Notes:**

- LCD L33829 retired 11/14/2024 - now follows NCD 280.6 only
- Single outflow port - basic nonsegmented compression
- Can be used with nonsegmented appliances (E0655, E0660, E0665, E0666) or gradient pressure appliances (E0671, E0672, E0673)
- Cannot be used with segmented appliances requiring multiple chamber control *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**

- Objective measurements documenting edema/ulceration required

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **DVS authorization required** before ordering
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- **Comprehensive documentation:**
  - Diagnosis (lymphedema or CVI with ulcers)
  - Measurements proving lymphedema/edema at multiple anatomical points
  - Conservative therapy attempts with dates:
    - Compression garment grade (â‰¥30mmHg)
    - Duration of trial (4 weeks lymphedema, 6 months CVI)
    - Compliance documentation
  - Clinical justification for pneumatic compression *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face encounter documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Delivery documentation maintained

**Important Notes:**

- DVS authorization pathway (not prior approval)
- Must specify appliance type needed with pump (half arm, full arm, half leg, full leg)
- Document conservative therapy compliance carefully *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Same requirements as Nassau County.** DVS authorization required, 4-week conservative failure for lymphedema or 6-month failure for CVI with ulcers.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Conservative therapy trial insufficient"** - Less than required time documented. Fix: Must document full 4-week trial for lymphedema OR 6-month trial for CVI with ulcers. Include start/end dates, garment grade (â‰¥30mmHg), compliance notes, exercise/elevation protocols. Cannot approve without adequate conservative trial. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"No compression garment grade documented"** - Conservative therapy not specified. Fix: Must document compression garment grade â‰¥30mmHg. Include garment type (stockings, sleeves), specific pressure grade, wearing schedule (daily), compliance notes. NCD requires â‰¥30mmHg minimum.

3. **"No objective measurements"** - Missing limb measurements. Fix: Document limb measurements at multiple anatomical points (e.g., wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm for arm lymphedema; ankle, calf, knee, thigh for leg). Compare measurements over time showing persistent/worsening edema despite conservative therapy. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Missing financial attestation"** (Medicare) - No prescriber financial disclosure. Fix: Prescriber must sign attestation that they have no financial relationship with DME supplier. Required Medicare fraud prevention measure. Include with WOPD.

5. **"No face-to-face encounter documented"** - F2F not recorded. Fix: Document face-to-face encounter date within appropriate timeframe before prescription. Include encounter notes showing examination of affected limb, measurements taken, conservative therapy discussion. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"CVI without ulcers"** - CVI diagnosis without ulceration. Fix: For CVI indication, venous stasis ulcers must be documented. CVI alone without ulceration not covered. If patient has CVI without ulcers, check if lymphedema diagnosis applies instead. Lower extremity only for CVI. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No WOPD"** (Medicare) - Order not completed before delivery. Fix: Complete Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) before device dispensed. Cannot deliver first, then get order. Order must be signed and dated before delivery date.

8. **"Segmented appliance ordered"** - E0667-E0669 requested with E0650. Fix: E0650 nonsegmental pump only compatible with nonsegmented appliances (E0655, E0660, E0665, E0666) or gradient appliances (E0671, E0672, E0673). For segmented appliances (E0667-E0669), must order E0651 or E0652 pump instead. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- LCD retired 11/14/2024 - simpler approval process following NCD 280.6 only *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document conservative therapy meticulously:**
  - Exact garment grade (e.g., "30-40mmHg compression stockings")
  - Specific dates (e.g., "Conservative trial 6/1/2025 - 6/29/2025")
  - Compliance notes (e.g., "Patient wore stockings daily for 4 weeks, performed elevation 3x daily")
  - Why conservative therapy failed (e.g., "Edema increased from 38cm to 42cm at calf despite 4 weeks daily 30mmHg compression") *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete WOPD before delivery - cannot retrofit
- Include financial attestation with prescription
- **Face-to-face encounter documented** with limb examination *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Objective measurements at multiple points strengthen case
- For lymphedema: 4-week minimum conservative trial
- For CVI: Must have ulcers + 6-month conservative trial

**Medicaid:**
- Obtain DVS authorization before ordering *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order should be comprehensive with all measurements
- Document conservative therapy with specific dates and compliance
- Include garment grade and wearing schedule
- Vascular or lymphedema specialist evaluation strengthens approval *(Under Review)*
- Face-to-face encounter documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Specify which appliance needed with pump (half arm, full arm, half leg, full leg)
