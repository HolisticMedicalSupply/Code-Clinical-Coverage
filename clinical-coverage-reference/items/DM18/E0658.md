# E0658 - Integrated Two Full Arms and Chest Pneumatic Compression System

## Clinical Overview

E0658 is a specialized integrated pneumatic compression system covering both full arms and chest wall simultaneously. This is a **new code effective October 1, 2025** for complex cases of bilateral upper extremity lymphedema with chest involvement. Typically prescribed for severe post-surgical lymphedema (bilateral mastectomy), post-radiation therapy affecting both arms and chest, or systemic lymphedema. The integrated design provides coordinated compression across both arms and chest in a single appliance system.

**Key Features:**
- **NEW CODE: Effective October 1, 2025**
- Integrated system: covers both full arms (shoulder to hand) AND chest simultaneously
- **REQUIRES E0652 pump with manual chamber control**
- Most common indication: Bilateral mastectomy with bilateral arm and chest lymphedema

**Typical Indications:**
- Bilateral mastectomy with bilateral arm lymphedema and chest wall involvement
- Post-radiation therapy bilateral lymphedema (both arms and chest)
- Systemic lymphedema affecting both arms and chest
- Severe/extensive lymphedema requiring integrated compression *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL:** This is highest-tier, most complex device. Only appropriate for bilateral arm lymphedema WITH chest involvement. Must justify why integrated system necessary vs. separate appliances.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Should use separate appliances"** - Integrated system not justified. Fix: Must document why integrated system medically necessary vs. using separate appliances (two E0668 arm sleeves + one E0657 chest appliance). Explain clinical benefits of coordinated bilateral compression, practical considerations (patient compliance with multiple appliances), medical necessity for integrated approach. Example: "Bilateral arm and chest lymphedema requires coordinated compression. Integrated E0658 system provides simultaneous bilateral arm and chest compression more effectively than separate appliances, ensuring proper pressure coordination and improving patient compliance." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Unilateral lymphedema only"** - Only one arm involved. Fix: E0658 requires BILATERAL upper extremity lymphedema. If only one arm affected, use E0668 (segmental full arm) + E0657 (chest) separately. Document measurements showing BOTH arms affected with lymphedema. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No chest involvement"** - Bilateral arms without chest lymphedema. Fix: E0658 requires both bilateral arm lymphedema AND chest involvement. If chest not involved, use two E0668 appliances (one for each arm). Document chest measurements showing chest wall lymphedema involvement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"E0650 or E0651 pump ordered"** - Wrong pump type. Fix: E0658 integrated system **REQUIRES E0652 pump** with manually calibrated gradient control. Cannot be used with E0650 or E0651. Complexity of bilateral arm and chest compression necessitates manual chamber pressure adjustment. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"E0652 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0658 appliance coverage absolutely depends on E0652 compressor approval. Ensure E0652 meets all criteria: unique patient characteristics (bilateral arm + chest involvement), highest documentation level, comprehensive measurements. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"No bilateral measurements"** - Missing measurements for one arm or chest. Fix: Must document measurements for BOTH arms (left and right: wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm) AND chest (circumference, chest wall involvement). Bilateral documentation critical to justify integrated system. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"New code not in system"** - Payer system not updated. Fix: E0658 is NEW CODE effective October 1, 2025. Contact payer to verify code is in system. Provide code effective date. May need to resubmit after payer updates. Medicare/Medicaid should have code active by 10/1/2025. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"No bilateral surgical history"** - Missing bilateral mastectomy details. Fix: For bilateral mastectomy cases, document both surgeries: dates, axillary node dissection for each side, radiation therapy. Bilateral surgical history supports medical necessity. Not required for all cases but strengthens approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **NEW CODE (10/1/2025) - verify payer system updated** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Focus on E0652 compressor approval first - appliance absolutely depends on pump
- **Bilateral measurements critical:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Document BOTH arms completely (left: wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm; right: wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm)
  - Document chest involvement (chest circumference, chest wall measurements)
  - Show bilateral arm AND chest lymphedema both present
- **For bilateral mastectomy cases:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Document both surgeries with dates
  - Axillary node dissection for each side (number of nodes)
  - Bilateral radiation therapy if received
  - Comprehensive surgical history strengthens case
- **Key to approval: Justify integrated system:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Example: "Bilateral mastectomy with bilateral arm lymphedema and chest wall involvement. Integrated E0658 system provides coordinated compression across both arms and chest simultaneously, ensuring proper pressure distribution and patient compliance. Separate appliances (two E0668 + E0657) would require coordination of three devices, increasing complexity and reducing compliance. Integrated system medically necessary for effective bilateral arm and chest compression."
- Complete all E0652 requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation
- Lymphedema specialist evaluation highly recommended *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Medicaid:**
- **NEW CODE - Monitor emedny.org for final coverage policy** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering** (full PA for high-cost integrated device)
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review early: (800) 342-3005
- **Specialist evaluation highly recommended** (lymphedema specialist, certified therapist)
- **Comprehensive fiscal order:**
  - Bilateral arm measurements (both arms completely documented)
  - Chest measurements showing involvement
  - Bilateral surgical history if applicable
  - Justification for integrated system vs. separate appliances
  - Treatment plan with expected outcomes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- High-cost integrated device - expect rigorous review
- Strong clinical justification critical
