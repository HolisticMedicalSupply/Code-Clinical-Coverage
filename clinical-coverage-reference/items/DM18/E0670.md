# E0670 - Integrated Two Full Legs and Trunk Pneumatic Compression System

## Clinical Overview

E0670 is a complex integrated pneumatic compression system covering both full legs and trunk/abdomen simultaneously. This is a **high-cost, complex device** requiring **PRIOR AUTHORIZATION from Medicare** (rare for DME). Only appropriate when bilateral leg lymphedema extends onto trunk/abdomen beyond what standard leg appliances can cover, and patient has unique characteristics preventing satisfactory treatment with less complex devices.

**ðŸš¨ MEDICARE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED - Complex/High-Cost Equipment**

**Key Features:**
- Integrated system: covers both full legs AND trunk/abdomen
- **REQUIRES E0652 pump with manual chamber control**
- **Medicare PA REQUIRED** (unusual for Medicare DME)
- **LCMP (Licensed Certified Manual Lymphedema Practitioner) evaluation required**
- Must document failed trial of E0651 + standard appliances

**Coverage Criteria:**
- Bilateral leg lymphedema extending to trunk/abdomen
- Unique patient characteristics
- Failed trial of E0651 with standard appliances (4+ weeks)
- Trunk/abdomen involvement beyond standard sleeve limits *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

Must meet **ALL E0652 compressor criteria** PLUS:

1. **Bilateral leg lymphedema extending onto trunk/abdomen** beyond standard compression sleeve limits

2. **Unique patient characteristics** preventing satisfactory treatment with:
   - Non-segmented devices (E0650 + appliances)
   - Standard segmented devices (E0651 + appliances) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **Failed 4-week trial** with E0651 device and conservative therapy documented

4. **Measurements documenting trunk/abdominal involvement** beyond leg boundaries

5. **Manual lymphatic drainage attempted**

6. **LCMP evaluation required** with attestation of no financial relationship *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED** - submit comprehensive package before ordering
- WOPD required
- Face-to-face encounter documented
- Financial attestation required
- **Comprehensive PA documentation:**
  - Lymphedema extending to trunk/abdomen beyond standard sleeve limits
  - Measurements: bilateral legs (both legs: ankle, calf, knee, thigh) AND trunk/abdomen
  - Failed 4-week trial with E0651 + standard appliances (dates, compliance, inadequate response)
  - Unique patient characteristics requiring trunk compression
  - Manual lymphatic drainage attempts documented
  - **LCMP evaluation with financial attestation** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Requires E0652 pump
- Treatment plan with expected outcomes

**Important Notes:**

- **Medicare PA REQUIRED** (rare for DME)
- LCMP evaluation mandatory
- Failed trial of E0651 required
- Only with E0652 pump

### NY Medicaid (Nassau/Brooklyn)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - bilateral leg lymphedema with trunk involvement

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Prior approval required** (not DVS - full PA)
- Comprehensive documentation:
  - Bilateral leg measurements (both legs complete)
  - Trunk/abdomen measurements
  - Failed trials of standard devices (E0650, E0651)
  - Specialist evaluation
  - Unique patient factors *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Only covered with approved E0652
- High-cost integrated device - strong justification required
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review: (800) 342-3005
