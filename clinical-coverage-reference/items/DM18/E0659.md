# E0659 - Integrated Head, Neck and Chest Pneumatic Compression System

## Clinical Overview

E0659 is an **extremely rare** integrated pneumatic compression system covering head, neck, and chest simultaneously. This is a **new code effective October 1, 2025** for rare/complex cases of lymphedema involving all three anatomical areas. Typically prescribed for post-surgical lymphedema following head/neck cancer surgery, congenital lymphatic malformations affecting the upper body, or systemic lymphedema.

**ðŸš¨ EXTREMELY RARE INDICATION - NEW CODE**

**Key Features:**
- **NEW CODE: Effective October 1, 2025**
- Integrated system: covers head, neck, AND chest simultaneously
- **REQUIRES E0652 pump with manual chamber control**
- **EXTREMELY RARE** - most complex integrated appliance
- Requires extensive documentation and specialist consultation

**Typical Indications:**
- Post-surgical lymphedema from head/neck cancer surgery with chest involvement
- Congenital lymphatic malformations affecting head, neck, and chest
- Systemic lymphedema affecting entire upper body
- Complex cases requiring integrated compression across all three regions *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL:** This is the rarest, most complex pneumatic compression device. Only appropriate when lymphedema affects ALL THREE areas (head, neck, chest) simultaneously. Requires specialist consultation and case-by-case review.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Only two areas affected"** - Not all three regions involved. Fix: E0659 requires lymphedema in ALL THREE areas: head, neck, AND chest. If only two areas affected, use appropriate combination of separate appliances. Document measurements showing all three regions affected with lymphedema. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Should use separate or less extensive appliances"** - Integrated system not justified. Fix: Must document why integrated head, neck, and chest system medically necessary vs. using separate appliances or less extensive options (E0657 chest only). Explain medical necessity for coordinated compression across all three regions, why separate appliances impractical or insufficient. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"No specialist consultation"** - Missing specialist evaluation. Fix: E0659 extremely rare/complex device requiring specialist consultation. Include notes from head/neck surgeon, lymphedema specialist, or other appropriate specialist documenting medical necessity for integrated system. Specialist evaluation mandatory for approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"E0652 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0659 absolutely requires E0652 pump. Ensure E0652 meets all criteria with extensive documentation for this rare indication. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"New code not in system"** - Payer system not updated. Fix: E0659 is NEW CODE effective October 1, 2025. Contact payer to verify code active. May need to resubmit after payer updates. For Medicaid, contact Bureau of Medical Review for coverage determination on new code. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
