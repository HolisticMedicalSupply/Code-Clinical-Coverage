# E0655 - Half Arm Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Below Elbow)

## Clinical Overview

E0655 is a nonsegmental pneumatic compression appliance (sleeve) for below-elbow lymphedema affecting the forearm and hand. This appliance is used with E0650 nonsegmental compressor for patients whose lymphedema is limited to the area below the elbow and does not extend to the upper arm. Most commonly used for post-mastectomy lymphedema or post-surgical lymphedema when edema is confined to forearm and hand.

**Key Features:**
- Covers forearm and hand only (below elbow)
- Nonsegmental design (uniform compression throughout)
- Used with E0650 compressor
- Included in initial E0650 setup *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**CRITICAL:** This is an accessory to the E0650 pump, not a standalone device. Coverage and authorization follow the E0650 compressor requirements.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

**Clinical Requirements:**

Must meet **ALL E0650 compressor criteria** (appliance is accessory):

1. **Upper extremity lymphedema** affecting below-elbow area (forearm and hand)
2. **Failed 4-week conservative therapy** including:
   - Compression garments ≥30mmHg worn daily
   - Elevation exercises
   - Limb elevation protocol *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **Objective measurements** of forearm and hand documenting edema
4. **Anatomical limitation:** Lymphedema confined to below-elbow region - if lymphedema extends above elbow, use E0665 full arm appliance instead *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **Same as E0650 compressor:**
  - WOPD required
  - Face-to-face encounter documented *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Conservative therapy failure documented (4 weeks)
  - Financial attestation required
- **Specific to E0655:**
  - **Forearm and hand measurements** at multiple points (wrist, mid-forearm, just below elbow)
  - **Document lymphedema does NOT extend above elbow** - if upper arm involved, use E0665 full arm instead *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - **Proper fit documentation** - must avoid tourniquet effect at elbow (proximal edge must not constrict)
  - Anatomical area specification: "Forearm and hand compression, below elbow"

**Important Notes:**

- Billed with E0650 compressor
- Included in initial E0650 setup - typically not separately billed at initial delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Replacement billing restrictions:** Cannot bill E0655 separately within 90 days of initial E0650 delivery
- Replacement after 90 days requires medical necessity documentation (damage, improper fit, size change) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Must document proper fit avoiding tourniquet effect at elbow edge

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Clinical Requirements:**
- Same as Medicare - below-elbow lymphedema (forearm and hand) after 4-week conservative failure
- Lymphedema must not extend above elbow (use E0665 if upper arm involved) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Requirements:**

- **DVS authorization required** (same as E0650 compressor)
- Fiscal order from authorized prescriber
- **Specify appliance need in E0650 authorization:**
  - Must specify "half arm appliance (E0655)" in E0650 authorization request
  - Limb measurements: wrist, forearm, just below elbow
  - Document lymphedema limited to below-elbow region
  - Anatomical area specification required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Included with E0650 authorization - not separately authorized *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Delivery documentation maintained

**Important Notes:**

- Coverage tied to E0650 DVS authorization
- Specify anatomical area (forearm and hand) in fiscal order
- Proper fit to avoid tourniquet effect at elbow *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

**Same requirements as Nassau County.** DVS authorization with E0650, specify half arm appliance need with forearm/hand measurements.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**

- [ ] **Lymphedema specification:**
  - [ ] Below-elbow lymphedema (forearm and hand)
  - [ ] Document lymphedema does NOT extend above elbow
  - [ ] If above elbow involvement, use E0665 full arm instead
- [ ] **Conservative therapy documentation:**
  - [ ] 4-week trial documented
  - [ ] Compression garment grade: _______mmHg (≥30mmHg)
  - [ ] Dates: Start _______ End _______
  - [ ] Compliance documented
- [ ] **Forearm and hand measurements:**
  - [ ] Wrist circumference: _______
  - [ ] Mid-forearm circumference: _______
  - [ ] Just below elbow circumference: _______
- [ ] **Proper fit documentation:**
  - [ ] Sleeve must avoid tourniquet effect at elbow
  - [ ] Proximal edge positioned to not constrict below elbow
- [ ] Physician signature and date
- [ ] Ordering provider NPI number

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] WOPD completed for E0650 compressor
- [ ] Face-to-face encounter documented
- [ ] Financial attestation signed
- [ ] E0655 specified as needed appliance with E0650

**For Medicaid:**

- [ ] Anatomical area documented (forearm and hand)
- [ ] Measurements included in authorization request

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Lymphedema extends above elbow"** - Full arm involvement documented. Fix: E0655 only covers below elbow (forearm and hand). If lymphedema extends to upper arm, must use E0665 full arm appliance instead. Review measurements - if bicep or upper arm edema present, E0665 appropriate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"E0650 compressor not approved"** - Appliance ordered without pump. Fix: E0655 is accessory to E0650 compressor. Cannot approve appliance without approved pump. Ensure E0650 meets all NCD 280.6 criteria (4-week conservative failure, measurements, WOPD, F2F, financial attestation) first. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Billed separately within 90 days"** - E0655 billed too soon after E0650 initial delivery. Fix: E0655 included in initial E0650 setup. Cannot bill E0655 separately within 90 days of initial E0650 delivery. If replacement needed before 90 days, document exceptional circumstances (rapid size change, unexpected damage). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No measurements below elbow"** - Missing forearm/hand measurements. Fix: Document measurements at wrist, mid-forearm, and just below elbow showing lymphedema in below-elbow region. Measurements should show edema confined to forearm and hand, not extending to upper arm. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Tourniquet effect not addressed"** - No fitting documentation. Fix: Must document proper fit avoiding tourniquet effect at elbow. Sleeve's proximal edge must not constrict circulation or cause edema worsening proximal to sleeve. Note proper fitting with no constriction at elbow. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** (for E0650) - E0650 pump denial affects appliance. Fix: E0655 coverage depends on E0650 approval. Ensure 4-week conservative therapy documented (compression garments ≥30mmHg, elevation, exercise) with dates and compliance. Cannot approve appliance if pump denied.

7. **"No anatomical area specified"** (Medicaid) - Fiscal order doesn't specify half arm. Fix: Fiscal order must clearly state "half arm appliance (E0655)" needed for forearm and hand lymphedema. Specify anatomical area to be covered by appliance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Focus on E0650 compressor approval first - appliance follows pump *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Document lymphedema limited to below-elbow region:**
  - Measurements showing forearm/hand edema
  - Note upper arm NOT involved (if upper arm edema, use E0665)
  - Specify "lymphedema confined to forearm and hand, does not extend above elbow" *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Include E0655 in initial E0650 order - typically delivered together *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Proper fit documentation:** Note sleeve positioned to avoid tourniquet effect at elbow
- For replacement (after 90 days), document necessity: damage, size change, improper fit causing complications *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete all E0650 requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation, conservative therapy failure

**Medicaid:**
- Include E0655 specification in E0650 DVS authorization request *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Fiscal order should state: "E0650 nonsegmental compressor with E0655 half arm appliance for below-elbow lymphedema (forearm and hand)"
- Measurements at wrist, forearm, below elbow documented
- Specify anatomical area clearly: "Forearm and hand compression needed"
- Note lymphedema does not extend to upper arm *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- DVS authorization covers both pump and appliance together *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
