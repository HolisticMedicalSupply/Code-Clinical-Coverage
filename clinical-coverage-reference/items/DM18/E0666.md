# E0666 - Half Leg Pneumatic Compression Sleeve (Below Knee)

## Clinical Overview

E0666 is a nonsegmental pneumatic compression appliance (sleeve) for below-knee lymphedema or chronic venous insufficiency with ulcers affecting the lower leg. This appliance covers the area from foot to just below the knee and is used with E0650 nonsegmental compressor. Common indication for patients whose edema or ulceration is limited to the calf and ankle region without thigh involvement.

**Key Features:**
- Covers below-knee area: foot, ankle, calf (to just below knee)
- Nonsegmental design (uniform compression)
- Used with E0650 compressor
- Dual indication: lymphedema OR CVI with ulcers

**Coverage Criteria:**
- **Lymphedema:** Failed 4-week conservative therapy
- **CVI with Ulcers:** Failed 6-month conservative therapy (lower extremity only)

**Reimbursement:** $89.56 per Medicare/Medicaid schedule

**CRITICAL:** Coverage tied to E0650 compressor approval. If edema extends above knee to thigh, use E0660 full leg instead.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage Criteria

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Edema extends above knee to thigh"** - Full leg involvement documented. Fix: E0666 only covers below knee (calf and ankle). If edema extends to thigh, must use E0660 full leg appliance instead. Review measurements - if thigh circumference increased, E0660 appropriate. Document edema limited to below-knee region for E0666 approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"E0650 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0666 is accessory to E0650 compressor. Cannot approve appliance without approved pump. Ensure E0650 meets all NCD 280.6 criteria: 4-week conservative failure (lymphedema) or 6-month failure (CVI with ulcers), measurements, WOPD, F2F, financial attestation. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Less than required time. Fix: For lymphedema, must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial. For CVI with ulcers, must document full 6-month conservative therapy trial. Include dates, compression stocking grade (≥30mmHg below-knee), compliance, elevation/exercise protocols, why failed. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"CVI without ulcers"** - CVI diagnosis without ulceration. Fix: For CVI indication, venous stasis ulcers must be documented. CVI alone without ulcers not covered. If patient has CVI without ulcers, check if lymphedema diagnosis applies instead. Document ulcer location (calf/ankle), size, characteristics if using CVI indication. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No below-knee measurements"** - Missing ankle/calf measurements. Fix: Must document measurements at ankle and calf showing edema in below-knee region. Measurements should demonstrate edema confined to lower leg, not extending to thigh. Compare to contralateral limb or baseline. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Should use E0660 full leg"** - Edema pattern suggests full leg involvement. Fix: If measurements show thigh edema or patient has risk of retrograde edema flow to thigh, E0660 full leg may be more appropriate. E0666 appropriate only when edema clearly limited to below knee without thigh involvement. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"Compression stocking grade not specified"** - Vague conservative therapy documentation. Fix: Must specify below-knee compression stocking grade (≥30mmHg). Include wearing schedule ("wore daily for 4 weeks" for lymphedema or "6 months" for CVI), compliance documentation. Generic "tried compression" insufficient. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

- Fiscal order should state: "E0650 nonsegmental compressor with E0666 half leg appliance for below-knee lymphedema/CVI with ulcers"
- **Measurements critical:** Document ankle and calf circumferences *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Specify below-knee region clearly:** Note edema/ulcers limited to calf and ankle, does not extend to thigh
- **For CVI with ulcers:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Vascular specialist evaluation strengthens approval
  - Document ulcer characteristics and 6-month wound care attempts
  - Explain why pneumatic compression expected to improve healing
- Document conservative therapy specifics: stocking grade, compliance, duration
- DVS authorization covers pump and appliance together *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
