# E0656 - Trunk Pneumatic Compression Appliance (Segmented)

## Clinical Overview

E0656 is a specialized segmented pneumatic compression appliance for trunk/abdomen compression. This is a **complex, high-tier device** used ONLY when lymphedema extends onto the trunk/abdomen beyond what standard limb appliances can cover. The appliance requires E0652 compressor with manually calibrated gradient control due to the complexity of trunk compression and the need for individualized chamber pressure titration.

**Key Features:**
- Covers trunk/abdomen beyond limb boundaries
- Segmented design with multiple chambers
- **REQUIRES E0652 pump with manual chamber control** (cannot be used with E0650 or E0651)
- Complex device requiring highest documentation level

**Typical Indication:**
- Lymphedema extending from limb onto trunk/abdomen
- Cannot be managed with limb-only appliances
- Requires trunk compression in addition to limb compression *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL:** This is NOT a first-line device. Only appropriate when lymphedema extends beyond standard limb appliance coverage onto trunk/abdomen, requiring specialized compression with manual chamber control.

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Should use limb-only appliances"** - Trunk compression not justified. Fix: Must document lymphedema extending onto trunk/abdomen beyond standard limb appliance boundaries. Show measurements of trunk/abdomen involvement. Explain why limb-only appliances (E0665, E0660, etc.) cannot adequately manage lymphedema extending to trunk. Example: "Lymphedema extends from arm onto chest and trunk. Arm appliance (E0665) only covers to shoulder - trunk involvement requires E0656 trunk appliance to address lymphedema extending onto torso." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"E0650 or E0651 pump ordered"** - Wrong pump type. Fix: E0656 trunk appliance **REQUIRES E0652 pump** with manually calibrated gradient control. Cannot be used with E0650 or E0651. Trunk involvement complexity necessitates manual chamber pressure adjustment capability. Must order E0652 pump with E0656 appliance. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"E0652 compressor not approved"** - Pump denial. Fix: E0656 appliance coverage absolutely depends on E0652 compressor approval. Ensure E0652 meets all NCD 280.6 criteria: unique patient characteristics (trunk involvement), failed trials of E0650/E0651, comprehensive documentation. Cannot approve E0656 without approved E0652 pump. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"No trunk measurements"** - Missing documentation of trunk involvement. Fix: Must document measurements showing lymphedema extends onto trunk/abdomen. Include waist circumference, abdomen circumference, measurements of specific trunk areas affected. Demonstrate lymphedema beyond limb boundaries. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"No failed trial of limb-only treatment"** - E0656 requested as first treatment. Fix: Typically must document trial of limb-only appliances (E0650 or E0651 with standard limb appliances) showing inadequate control of lymphedema extending to trunk. Example: "4-week trial of E0651 with E0665 full arm appliance showed arm edema improved but trunk involvement progressed. Trunk appliance (E0656) necessary to address lymphedema extending beyond arm onto torso." *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

6. **"Medical necessity for trunk compression not explained"** - Vague justification. Fix: Must clearly explain why trunk compression medically necessary. Document specific trunk/abdomen areas affected by lymphedema, why these areas cannot be adequately managed without trunk appliance, expected clinical benefits of trunk compression. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

7. **"No specialist evaluation"** (Medicaid) - Complex device without specialist input. Fix: Medicaid PA for E0656 strongly enhanced by lymphedema specialist or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation documenting trunk involvement and medical necessity for specialized trunk appliance. Not explicitly required but greatly strengthens approval. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

8. **"Conservative therapy insufficient"** - Missing or incomplete conservative therapy. Fix: Same as E0652 requirements - must document full 4-week conservative therapy trial including compression garments â‰¥30mmHg, elevation, exercise. Include dates, compliance, why failed.

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **This is highest-tier, most complex appliance - strongest documentation required** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Focus on E0652 compressor approval first - appliance absolutely depends on pump
- **Key to approval: Document trunk involvement beyond limb boundaries** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Trunk measurements showing lymphedema extends onto torso
  - Specific areas: waist, abdomen, chest (if applicable)
  - Demonstrate standard limb appliances cannot cover affected areas
- **Document failed trial of limb-only treatment:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - Example: "Patient tried E0651 with E0665 full arm appliance for 4 weeks. Arm edema improved from 42cm to 38cm at upper arm, but trunk involvement progressed with waist increasing from 92cm to 97cm. Arm appliance covers to shoulder only - trunk lymphedema requires E0656 trunk appliance with E0652 manual control."
- **Medical necessity statement should be explicit:** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
  - "Lymphedema extends from left arm onto left trunk and abdomen. Standard arm appliance (E0665) coverage ends at shoulder - cannot address trunk involvement. E0656 trunk appliance medically necessary to compress trunk/abdomen areas affected by lymphedema extending beyond limb boundaries. Manual chamber control (E0652) required for trunk compression complexity."
- Lymphedema specialist or certified lymphedema therapist evaluation adds significant credibility *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Complete all E0652 requirements: WOPD, F2F, financial attestation, unique characteristics

**Medicaid:**
- **Obtain prior approval BEFORE ordering** (not DVS - full PA review for complex device) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Contact Bureau of Medical Review early: (800) 342-3005
- **Specialist evaluation highly recommended** (lymphedema specialist, certified therapist) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **Comprehensive fiscal order essential:**
  - Trunk measurements documented
  - Lymphedema extending past limb boundaries clearly explained
  - Medical necessity for trunk compression detailed
  - Failed trials of less complex devices documented
  - Treatment plan with expected outcomes *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- High-cost specialized device - expect rigorous review
- Strong clinical justification critical for approval
