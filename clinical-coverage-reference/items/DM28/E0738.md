## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary - conventional therapy sufficient"** - Device not justified. Fix: Document patient plateaued with conventional occupational therapy - provide therapy notes showing lack of progress over 3-6 months. Establish BCI technology offers therapeutic advantage: intensive repetitive task practice with neurofeedback not achievable with conventional therapy. Document functional goals (ADL improvements) expected with BCI system. Justify why patient is appropriate candidate for advanced rehabilitation technology.

2. **"Insufficient documentation of chronic stroke with upper extremity deficits"** - Diagnosis not established. Fix: Document stroke history: date of stroke event (must be >6 months for chronic phase), type of stroke (ischemic/hemorrhagic), affected side (hemiplegia/hemiparesis). Provide neurological exam showing persistent upper extremity motor impairment: weakness, limited ROM, poor coordination, ADL limitations. Include functional assessment with baseline measures (Fugl-Meyer, ARAT scores). Establish chronic deficit requiring ongoing rehabilitation.

3. **"No face-to-face encounter documented"** *(Medicare)* - Missing required documentation. Fix: Document face-to-face encounter with prescribing physician within appropriate timeframe. Include: upper extremity examination, functional assessment, rehabilitation goals discussion, device medical necessity evaluation. Date, provider, and clinical findings must be documented.

4. **"Patient not capable of using BCI technology"** - Cognitive/functional limitation. Fix: Document patient cognitive ability sufficient for BCI control: able to understand instructions, generate motor imagery, attend to feedback signals. May require cognitive screening (MOCA, MiniMental). Establish patient motivated and capable of home-based rehabilitation with BCI system. If cognitive deficits present, document why patient still appropriate candidate or consider supervised clinical use.

5. **"Home use not appropriate - requires supervised clinical setting"** - Safety/appropriateness concern. Fix: Document home environment suitable for device use: adequate space, electrical access, caregiver support if needed. Establish patient capable of independent or caregiver-assisted device use at home. If device used in clinical setting (outpatient therapy), document supervised use plan. Provide training documentation showing patient/caregiver trained on device operation.

6. **"Coverage not established"** *(NY Medicaid)* - No Medicaid policy. Fix: E0738 not in current NY Medicaid DME manual as of 10/1/2025. Must contact Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005) for prior approval inquiry. Submit comprehensive documentation: stroke history, upper extremity deficits, conventional therapy failure, medical necessity justification, BCI technology rationale. Request coverage determination. Monitor emedny.org for policy updates. Consider Medicare or private insurance if Medicaid denies.

7. **"Alternative therapies not tried or documented"** - Insufficient treatment progression. Fix: Document conventional therapy attempts: occupational therapy (duration, frequency, specific techniques tried), constraint-induced movement therapy, home exercise program, other modalities. Provide progress notes showing insufficient improvement or plateau. Establish BCI system as next appropriate step in rehabilitation continuum after conventional approaches failed or plateaued.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **DME classification** - standard DME documentation requirements apply
- **Capped rental** - 13-month rental period (~$20,504 total)
- **No specific LCD** - follows general DME medical necessity criteria
- Standard Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face encounter recommended *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Supplier should verify coverage and pricing with Medicare before delivery

**NY Medicaid:**
- **NOT in current DME manual (as of 10/1/2025)** - coverage not established
- **MUST contact Bureau of Medical Review for prior approval inquiry:**
  - Phone: (800) 342-3005
  - Email: OHIPMedPA@health.ny.gov
- **Check emedny.org** for any updates on E0738 coverage policy
- **Submit comprehensive prior approval request** if pursuing Medicaid coverage
- **Likely to follow Medicare criteria if coverage established** *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Documentation Best Practices:**

**Establish Chronic Stroke with Upper Extremity Deficit:**
- Document stroke date (must be chronic phase - typically >6 months)
- Neurological exam: hemiplegia/hemiparesis affecting upper extremity
- Functional assessment: ADL limitations (dressing, feeding, grooming due to arm/hand impairment)
- Baseline functional measures: Fugl-Meyer Assessment (motor score), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)
- Example: "Patient suffered left MCA ischemic stroke 14 months ago. Persistent right upper extremity hemiparesis: shoulder flexion 3/5, elbow extension 2/5, hand grasp 1/5. Unable to perform ADLs with right hand - requires assistance with dressing, feeding, grooming. Fugl-Meyer motor score: 28/66 (severe impairment). ARAT: 12/57 (poor function)."

**Justify Medical Necessity for BCI System:**
- Document conventional therapy plateau:
  - "Patient completed 6 months outpatient occupational therapy (3x/week) post-stroke. Minimal functional improvement despite intensive conventional therapy. Fugl-Meyer score improved only 5 points (23→28) over 6 months - plateaued."
- Establish BCI therapeutic advantage:
  - "BCI-assisted rehabilitation provides intensive repetitive task practice (500+ repetitions per session) with real-time neurofeedback - not achievable with conventional therapy. Thought-actuated movement facilitates neuroplasticity and cortical reorganization. Patient appropriate candidate for advanced rehabilitation technology."
- Set measurable functional goals:
  - "Rehabilitation goals: improve Fugl-Meyer motor score by 10+ points, achieve functional grasp for ADL tasks (feeding utensil use, dressing), increase ARAT score to >20 (fair function)."

**Document Cognitive Ability for BCI Use:**
- Cognitive screening if available: "MOCA score 26/30 - cognitive function adequate for BCI task demands"
- Attention and motivation: "Patient attentive, motivated for rehabilitation, able to follow multi-step instructions"
- Motor imagery ability: "Patient able to imagine upper extremity movements and generate motor imagery for BCI control"

**Patient Selection Criteria** *(general guidelines based on BCI research)*:
- **Good candidates:**
  - Chronic stroke (>6 months) with persistent UE impairment
  - Moderate to severe upper extremity weakness (Fugl-Meyer 15-45)
  - Plateaued with conventional therapy
  - Motivated for intensive home rehabilitation
  - Cognitively intact (able to follow instructions, generate motor imagery)
- **Poor candidates:**
  - Acute or subacute stroke (<6 months) - maximize conventional therapy first
  - Minimal deficit (Fugl-Meyer >50) - less likely to benefit
  - Severe cognitive impairment - cannot attend to BCI feedback
  - Unmotivated or unreliable for home use

**Length of Need:**
- Medicare capped rental: 13 months
- BCI research suggests 12-week intensive programs common
- Document expected duration: "Patient requires 6-month intensive BCI-assisted rehabilitation program (capped rental device) with potential for continued benefit throughout 13-month period"

**Supplier Coordination:**
- IpsiHand is primary device using E0738 code
- Supplier must coordinate Medicare pricing (capped rental rates)
- NY Medicaid: Supplier should contact Medicaid with prescriber for prior approval inquiry
- Device includes training for patient/caregiver - document completion
