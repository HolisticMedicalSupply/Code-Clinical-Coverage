## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Not medically necessary - conventional therapy sufficient"** - Device not justified. Fix: Document patient requires intensive high-dose repetitive task practice not achievable with conventional therapy alone. Establish robotic exoskeleton provides guided therapeutic activities with hundreds of repetitions per session - therapist-guided conventional therapy limited to lower dose. Document functional goals (ADL improvements for upper extremity, gait/mobility improvements for lower extremity) expected with robotic-assisted rehabilitation. Justify why patient appropriate candidate for advanced rehabilitation technology.

2. **"Insufficient documentation of stroke-related impairment"** - Diagnosis not established. Fix: Document stroke or neurological event: date, type (ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, CP, TBI), affected side. Provide neurological exam showing persistent extremity impairment: **Upper extremity:** weakness, limited ROM, poor coordination, ADL limitations. **Lower extremity:** ankle/foot weakness (dorsiflexion/plantar flexion), gait abnormalities (foot drop, circumduction), mobility limitations. Include functional assessment with baseline measures. Establish functional deficit requiring intensive rehabilitation.

3. **"No face-to-face encounter documented"** *(Medicare)* - Missing required documentation. Fix: Document face-to-face encounter with prescribing physician within appropriate timeframe. Include: extremity examination (upper or lower depending on device), functional assessment, rehabilitation goals discussion, device medical necessity evaluation. Date, provider, and clinical findings must be documented.

4. **"Device not appropriate for home use"** - Safety/appropriateness concern. Fix: Document home environment suitable for device use: adequate space, stable surface, electrical access, caregiver support if needed. Establish patient capable of independent or caregiver-assisted device use at home. Document patient trained on device operation and safety precautions. If device used in clinical setting, document supervised use plan with outpatient therapy schedule.

5. **"Alternative therapies not tried or documented"** - Insufficient treatment progression. Fix: Document conventional therapy attempts: **Upper extremity:** occupational therapy (duration, frequency, specific techniques tried). **Lower extremity:** physical therapy (gait training, ankle strengthening, functional mobility). Provide progress notes showing insufficient improvement or need for higher dose therapy. Establish robotic exoskeleton as appropriate adjunct to conventional therapy for intensive repetitive task practice.

6. **"Coverage not established"** *(NY Medicaid)* - No Medicaid policy. Fix: E0739 not in current NY Medicaid DME manual. Must submit prior approval request through DVS or direct submission. Contact Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005) for guidance. Submit comprehensive documentation: neurological diagnosis (stroke, CP, TBI), extremity impairment, conventional therapy history, medical necessity justification, robotic rehabilitation rationale. Request coverage determination. Monitor emedny.org for policy updates. Consider Medicare or private insurance if Medicaid denies.

7. **"Patient not appropriate candidate for robotic rehabilitation"** - Clinical limitation. Fix: Document patient appropriate for robotic-assisted therapy: **Cognitive:** able to follow instructions, attend to feedback signals. **Motor:** sufficient residual movement for device interaction (device assists movement, doesn't replace it entirely). **Motivation:** engaged in rehabilitation, compliant with home exercise. **Safety:** no contraindications (severe spasticity, joint instability, skin breakdown at device contact areas). Establish patient safety profile and candidacy for robotic rehabilitation.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **DME classification** - standard DME documentation requirements apply
- **Capped rental** - 13-month rental period (~$11,547 total)
- **Lower cost than E0738** - E0739 (~$11,547) vs E0738 (~$20,504)
- **No specific LCD** - follows general DME medical necessity criteria
- Standard Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face encounter recommended *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Supplier should verify coverage and pricing with Medicare before delivery

**NY Medicaid:**
- **NOT in current DME manual** - coverage not established
- **MUST submit prior approval request:**
  - DVS (Dispensing Validation System) OR
  - Direct submission to Bureau of Medical Review
  - Phone: (800) 342-3005
  - Email: OHIPMedPA@health.ny.gov
- **Check emedny.org** for updates on E0739 coverage policy
- **Broader indications than Medicare** - may cover stroke, CP, TBI *(if policy established)*

**Documentation Best Practices:**

**Motus Hand (Upper Extremity):**
- Document stroke with upper extremity hemiparesis/hemiplegia
- Functional assessment: ADL limitations (dressing, feeding, grooming, reaching, grasping)
- Baseline measures: Fugl-Meyer Assessment - Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)
- Rehabilitation goals: Improve hand/wrist function, achieve functional grasp, increase ADL independence
- Example: "Patient suffered left MCA stroke 8 months ago. Persistent right upper extremity hemiparesis: shoulder flexion 3/5, elbow extension 3/5, wrist extension 2/5, hand grasp 2/5. Unable to perform bimanual ADLs. FMA-UE: 32/66 (moderate impairment). ARAT: 18/57 (poor function). Requires intensive high-dose repetitive task practice with robotic assistance to maximize upper extremity motor recovery."

**Motus Foot (Lower Extremity):**
- Document stroke with lower extremity hemiparesis, ankle/foot weakness, gait impairment
- Functional assessment: Gait abnormalities (foot drop, circumduction gait, reduced push-off), mobility limitations, fall risk
- Baseline measures: Fugl-Meyer Assessment - Lower Extremity (FMA-LE), gait speed (10-meter walk test), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI)
- Rehabilitation goals: Improve ankle/foot motor control, normalize gait pattern, increase gait speed, reduce fall risk
- Example: "Patient suffered right MCA stroke 6 months ago. Persistent left ankle/foot weakness: dorsiflexion 2/5, plantar flexion 3/5. Gait abnormalities: left foot drop requiring AFO, circumduction gait pattern, reduced gait speed (0.4 m/s, normal >1.0 m/s). Fall risk: TUG 25 seconds (high risk >13.5 sec). Requires intensive ankle/foot robotic rehabilitation for high-dose repetitive dorsiflexion/plantarflexion practice to improve gait mechanics."

**Justify High-Dose Repetitive Task Practice:**
- Robotic exoskeleton enables 300-500+ repetitions per session
- Conventional therapy limited to 50-100 repetitions per session (therapist-guided)
- Motor learning principles: high dose + repetition + feedback = neuroplasticity
- Example: "Patient requires high-dose repetitive task practice (400+ repetitions per session) with real-time biofeedback to facilitate motor learning and neuroplasticity. Conventional therapy alone limited to ~75 repetitions per session. Robotic exoskeleton provides intensive practice dose not achievable with therapist-guided conventional therapy."

**Alternative Therapies Documentation:**
- Document conventional therapy attempts and results
- **Upper extremity:** Occupational therapy (duration, frequency, techniques - task practice, constraint-induced therapy, functional activities)
- **Lower extremity:** Physical therapy (gait training, ankle strengthening, functional mobility, AFO use)
- Example: "Patient completed 3 months conventional PT/OT (3x/week) post-stroke. Modest improvement but continued significant functional limitations. FMA-UE improved 7 points (25→32) but remains moderately impaired. Requires adjunctive robotic rehabilitation to augment conventional therapy with higher dose repetitive practice."

**Patient Selection Criteria** *(general guidelines)*:
- **Good candidates:**
  - Post-stroke with persistent extremity impairment (upper or lower)
  - Moderate impairment (some residual movement but significant functional limitation)
  - Motivated for intensive home rehabilitation
  - Cognitively intact (able to follow instructions, respond to feedback)
  - Safe for home use (or supervised clinic use arranged)
- **Poor candidates:**
  - Minimal deficit (near-normal function) - less likely to benefit
  - Severe spasticity - may interfere with device interaction
  - Severe cognitive impairment - cannot attend to biofeedback
  - Unstable medical condition

**Device Variants - Specify in Prescription:**
- **Motus Hand:** For upper extremity (hand, wrist, forearm) - post-stroke upper extremity hemiparesis
- **Motus Foot:** For lower extremity (ankle, foot) - post-stroke lower extremity hemiparesis with gait impairment
- Ensure prescription specifies which variant needed based on patient's functional deficit

**Length of Need:**
- Medicare capped rental: 13 months
- Intensive rehabilitation programs typically 8-12 weeks
- Document expected duration: "Patient requires 6-month intensive robotic-assisted rehabilitation program (capped rental device) to maximize functional motor recovery"

**Supplier Coordination:**
- Motus Hand/Foot are primary devices using E0739 code
- Supplier must coordinate Medicare pricing (capped rental rates)
- NY Medicaid: Supplier should coordinate prior approval submission with prescriber
- Device includes training for patient/caregiver - document completion
