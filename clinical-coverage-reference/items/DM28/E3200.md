# E3200 - Gait Modulation System - Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (InTandem)

## Clinical Overview

E3200 is a **gait modulation system** using rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) therapy for chronic stroke patients with gait impairment and ambulation deficits. The InTandem system (by MedRhythms) uses wearable sensors and music to provide real-time auditory cueing that synchronizes with the patient's gait pattern, facilitating gait rehabilitation through neurologic music therapy.

**Key Features:**
- **Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) therapy** - music-based neurologic rehabilitation
- **Wearable sensors** - real-time gait analysis and monitoring
- **Restricted therapy software** - prescription-only system with clinician-managed protocols
- **For chronic stroke with gait impairment** - ambulatory patients requiring gait rehabilitation
- **Home-based rehabilitation** - patient must be capable of independent device use at home
- **NEW CODE** - Effective October 1, 2024; pricing effective April 1, 2025

**Typical Clinical Context:**
- Patient suffered stroke with persistent gait impairment (hemiparetic gait)
- Gait abnormalities: asymmetry, reduced speed, decreased cadence, impaired balance
- Patient ambulatory (able to walk with or without assistive device)

## Common Denial Reasons

**Note:** E3200 is a very new code (effective October 2024) - denial reasons below are anticipated based on general DME criteria and similar gait rehabilitation devices.

1. **"Not medically necessary - conventional gait training sufficient"** - Device not justified. Fix: Document patient requires intensive home-based gait rehabilitation with auditory cueing not achievable with conventional PT alone. Establish RAS therapy provides continuous auditory feedback for every step during home ambulation - PT limited to 1-3 sessions/week. Document functional goals (increase gait speed from 0.5 m/s to >0.8 m/s for community ambulation, improve gait symmetry, reduce fall risk) expected with RAS gait modulation. Justify why patient appropriate candidate for auditory-cued gait rehabilitation technology.

2. **"Insufficient documentation of chronic stroke with gait impairment"** - Diagnosis not established. Fix: Document stroke history: date (chronic phase >6 months typically), type (ischemic/hemorrhagic), affected side. Provide gait assessment: **Gait speed:** 0.45 m/s (normal >1.0 m/s, limited community ambulation <0.8 m/s). **Gait abnormalities:** hemiparetic gait pattern with asymmetry, reduced cadence, impaired balance. **Fall risk:** TUG 18 seconds (high risk >13.5 sec). **Functional limitations:** requires assistive device, limited community ambulation, fall history. Establish persistent gait/mobility impairment requiring intensive rehabilitation.

3. **"Patient not ambulatory - not appropriate for gait modulation device"** - Ambulation requirement. Fix: E3200 is for **ambulatory** patients capable of walking (with or without assistive device). Document patient ambulatory status: able to walk independently or with assistive device (cane, walker, AFO), safe for home ambulation, capable of gait training. If patient non-ambulatory or severely impaired mobility, E3200 not appropriate - consider alternative rehabilitation interventions (wheelchair mobility training, transfer training, pre-gait strengthening).

4. **"Home use not appropriate - patient requires supervised gait training"** - Safety/capability concern. Fix: Document patient safe for home-based device use: ambulatory at home (with assistive device if needed), cognitively able to follow auditory cues, capable of donning/doffing wearable sensors independently or with caregiver assistance. Establish home environment safe for gait training (adequate space, clear pathways, fall risk mitigation). If patient requires supervised gait training due to fall risk, document device will be used during supervised home therapy sessions or consider outpatient PT instead.

5. **"No face-to-face encounter documented"** *(Medicare)* - Missing required documentation. Fix: Document face-to-face encounter with prescribing physician within appropriate timeframe. Include: gait examination (gait speed, pattern, symmetry, balance), functional assessment (mobility limitations, fall risk), rehabilitation goals discussion, device medical necessity evaluation. Date, provider, and clinical findings must be documented.

6. **"Alternative therapies not tried or documented"** - Insufficient treatment progression. Fix: Document conventional gait training attempts: physical therapy (duration, frequency, specific gait training techniques - treadmill training, overground gait, balance training). Provide progress notes showing insufficient improvement or need for higher dose home-based gait training. Establish RAS gait modulation as appropriate adjunct to conventional PT for intensive home-based gait rehabilitation with auditory cueing.

7. **"Coverage not established"** *(NY Medicaid)* - No Medicaid policy. Fix: E3200 too new for NY Medicaid policy (code effective October 2024, not in DME manual as of 10/1/2025). Monitor emedny.org for coverage updates. Contact Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005) for current status. When/if coverage established, submit prior approval with comprehensive documentation: chronic stroke, gait impairment, conventional therapy history, medical necessity justification, RAS therapy rationale. Consider Medicare or private insurance if Medicaid coverage not established.

8. **"Restricted therapy software - requires prescription and clinical oversight"** - Prescription-only device. Fix: E3200 includes "restricted therapy software, prescription only" - must be prescribed by licensed physician with clinical oversight. Document prescribing provider credentials, treatment plan with specific gait training protocols, monitoring plan (follow-up evaluations, therapy adjustments). Establish appropriate clinical oversight for prescription-only rehabilitation device.

## Tips for Prescribers

**Medicare:**
- **NEW CODE** - Effective October 1, 2024; pricing effective April 1, 2025
- **DME classification** - capped rental basis
- **No specific LCD yet** - follows general DME medical necessity criteria
- **Verify coverage and pricing** with Medicare/supplier before prescribing (new code, policies evolving)
- Standard Written Order Prior to Delivery (WOPD) likely required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Face-to-face encounter recommended *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- **CODE TOO NEW FOR POLICY** - Not in DME manual as of 10/1/2025
- **Monitor emedny.org regularly** for E3200 coverage policy updates
- **Contact Bureau of Medical Review** before prescribing:
  - Phone: (800) 342-3005
  - Email: OHIPMedPA@health.ny.gov
- **Consider alternative payer options** (Medicare, private insurance) for patients needing device now
- **When coverage established:** Likely to require prior approval, fiscal order, neurologist/physiatrist/PT evaluation

**Documentation Best Practices:**

**Establish Chronic Stroke with Gait Impairment:**
- Document stroke date (chronic phase - typically >6 months post-stroke)
- Neurological exam: hemiparesis affecting lower extremity, gait pattern abnormalities
- **Gait assessment with objective measures:**
  - **Gait speed (10-meter walk test):** Normal >1.0 m/s, household ambulation 0.4-0.8 m/s, limited community ambulation <0.8 m/s
  - **Endurance (6-minute walk test):** Normal >400 meters, community ambulation >300 meters
  - **Fall risk (Timed Up and Go):** Normal <10 sec, low risk 10-13.5 sec, high risk >13.5 sec
  - **Gait pattern:** Asymmetry, reduced cadence, decreased step length, impaired balance
- Example: "Patient suffered right MCA stroke 10 months ago. Persistent left lower extremity hemiparesis affecting gait. Gait speed: 0.52 m/s (limited community ambulation, normal >1.0 m/s). Hemiparetic gait pattern: left step length reduced, decreased cadence, asymmetric timing. TUG: 16 seconds (high fall risk, normal <10 sec). Fall history: 2 falls in past 3 months. Limited to household ambulation due to slow speed and fall risk."

**Justify Medical Necessity for RAS Gait Modulation:**
- Document conventional gait training plateau or insufficient dose:
  - "Patient completed 12 weeks outpatient PT (2x/week) post-stroke. Gait speed improved modestly (0.35→0.52 m/s) but remains below community ambulation threshold (<0.8 m/s). Plateaued in conventional PT - requires higher dose home-based gait training."
- Establish RAS therapeutic advantage:
  - "RAS gait modulation provides continuous auditory cueing for every step during home ambulation (30+ minutes daily) - significantly higher dose than conventional PT (2 sessions/week, 30 min gait training per session). Auditory cueing facilitates gait rhythm, symmetry, and cadence through neurologic music therapy principles. Patient appropriate candidate for intensive home-based RAS gait rehabilitation."
- Set measurable functional goals:
  - "Rehabilitation goals: Increase gait speed to >0.8 m/s (community ambulation threshold), improve gait symmetry (reduce step length asymmetry from 15% to <10%), reduce fall risk (TUG <13.5 seconds), achieve independent community ambulation."

**Document Ambulatory Status and Home Capability:**
- Patient must be ambulatory: "Patient ambulatory with cane - able to walk independently at home with assistive device"
- Home safety: "Home environment safe for gait training - adequate space, clear pathways, handrails available"
- Cognitive ability: "Patient cognitively intact (MOCA 27/30) - able to follow auditory cues and use wearable device"
- Example: "Patient ambulatory with single-point cane for community distances. Safe for home-based gait training with RAS device. Cognitively able to don/doff wearable sensors and follow auditory cue protocol. Caregiver available for device setup assistance if needed."

**Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) Therapy Mechanism:**
- RAS is a neurologic music therapy technique using rhythmic auditory cues (music, metronome) to synchronize gait pattern
- Mechanism: Auditory cues entrain motor system, facilitating rhythmic movement patterns
- Evidence: RAS improves gait speed, cadence, symmetry in chronic stroke patients
- InTandem system: Wearable sensors detect gait pattern in real-time, software adapts music tempo to guide patient toward target gait parameters
- Document rationale: "Patient will benefit from RAS therapy using InTandem device - auditory cueing to improve gait rhythm, increase cadence, enhance gait symmetry, and facilitate motor learning through intensive home-based practice."

**Patient Selection Criteria** *(general guidelines based on RAS research)*:
- **Good candidates:**
  - Chronic stroke (>6 months) with persistent gait impairment
  - Ambulatory (household or limited community ambulation)
  - Gait asymmetry, reduced cadence, slow speed - modifiable gait parameters
  - Motivated for intensive home-based gait training
  - Cognitively intact (able to follow auditory cues)
  - Hearing adequate to perceive auditory cues
- **Poor candidates:**
  - Non-ambulatory or severely impaired mobility (requires pre-gait rehabilitation first)
  - Near-normal gait speed/pattern (minimal deficit, less likely to benefit)
  - Severe cognitive impairment (cannot attend to auditory cues)
  - Hearing impairment (cannot perceive auditory cueing)
  - Severe balance impairment (fall risk too high for home-based gait training without supervision)

**Alternative Therapies Documentation:**
- Document conventional PT gait training attempts and results
- Gait training techniques tried: Treadmill training, overground gait training, balance exercises, task-specific training
- Progress: Document baseline and follow-up gait measures showing plateau or insufficient improvement
- Example: "Patient completed 12 weeks outpatient PT (2x/week) with conventional gait training: treadmill training, overground gait practice, balance exercises. Gait speed improved 0.17 m/s (0.35→0.52 m/s) but plateaued weeks 8-12 (no further improvement). Remains below community ambulation threshold. Requires adjunctive RAS gait modulation for higher dose intensive home-based gait training to augment conventional PT."

**Length of Need:**
- Medicare capped rental - specific terms not yet established *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- RAS research programs typically 4-8 weeks intensive training
- Document expected duration: "Patient requires 6-month intensive home-based RAS gait rehabilitation program (capped rental device) to maximize gait recovery and achieve community ambulation goals"

**Supplier/Device Coordination:**
- InTandem (MedRhythms) is primary device using E3200 code
- **Prescription-only device** - restricted therapy software requires clinical oversight
- Supplier must coordinate Medicare pricing (new code, capped rental rates not yet widely established)
- Device includes wearable sensors, software, auditory cueing (music/metronome)
- Patient/caregiver training on device use - document completion

**Monitor New Code Policies:**
- E3200 very new code (pricing effective April 2025)
- Medicare policies may evolve - verify coverage requirements with supplier/Medicare before prescribing
- NY Medicaid policy pending - monitor emedny.org for updates
- Contact payers for current coverage status and documentation requirements
