**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
- Cervical fracture imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI)
- Neurosurgical/orthopedic evaluation
- Stability assessment
- Treatment plan with traction specifications

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] **Active fracture frame documented** (E0920, E0930, or E0946)
- [ ] **Cervical fracture imaging** (X-ray, CT, MRI) with radiologist report
- [ ] Fracture classification (Denis, AO/ASIF, etc.)
