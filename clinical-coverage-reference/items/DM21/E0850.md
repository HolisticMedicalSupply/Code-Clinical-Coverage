# E0850 - Free-Standing Cervical Traction Stand

## ðŸš¨ MEDICARE: NOT REASONABLE AND NECESSARY (E0860 Preferred)

## Clinical Overview
Free-standing cervical traction stand. **Medicare considers NOT reasonable and necessary** - E0860 (overdoor) preferred.

- [ ] ICD-10: M50.1x (cervical disc disorders), M54.12 (radiculopathy), S13.4 (cervical strain), M47.812 (cervical spondylosis)
- [ ] **Justify why overdoor device (E0860) inadequate** - home setup limitations

2. **"Overdoor inadequacy not justified"** (Medicaid) - Fix: **Document why E0860 inadequate**: door frame unsuitable, home setup requires free-standing unit. *(verified from source)*

3. **"Home assessment not completed"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Complete home assessment documenting space, why door frame unsuitable. *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval
