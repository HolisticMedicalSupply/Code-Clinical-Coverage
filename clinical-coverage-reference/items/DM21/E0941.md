# E0941 - Gravity/Inversion Traction Device

## ⚠️ MEDICARE: LIMITED COVERAGE (Verify before ordering)

## Clinical Overview
Gravity-assisted traction device (inversion table, gravity decompression) for chronic back pain with radiculopathy, disc herniation, spinal stenosis *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

**Medicare:** LIMITED coverage - often NOT covered
**Medicaid:** DVS authorization, F26 continuous monthly rental

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** LIMITED - special coverage instructions
**WARNING:** Non-surgical decompression often NOT covered by Medicare *(Under Review - High Confidence)* - **verify coverage before ordering**

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization
**F26 frequency:** Continuous monthly rental ($1.73/day)
**Requirements:**
- DVS authorization required (changed from PA)
- Conservative therapy failure documented
- Specific diagnosis
- Ability to safely use device confirmed
- **Contraindications ruled out:** Cardiovascular conditions, eye conditions

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] **Code: "E0941 - Gravity assisted traction device"**
- [ ] ICD-10: M54.16 (lumbar radiculopathy), M54.12 (cervical), M51.26 (disc herniation), M48.06/07 (stenosis)
- [ ] **Conservative therapy failure documented**
- [ ] Specific diagnosis with radiculopathy or disc pathology
- [ ] **Ability to safely use device confirmed**
- [ ] **Contraindications ruled out** (cardiovascular, eye conditions)

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **VERIFY coverage before ordering** - often NOT covered
- [ ] Special coverage instructions reviewed

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] **DVS authorization obtained BEFORE ordering**
- [ ] F26 continuous monthly rental confirmed
- [ ] Conservative therapy failure documented
- [ ] Contraindications ruled out

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: **Obtain DVS authorization (#) BEFORE ordering E0941.** All gravity traction devices require DVS authorization for NY Medicaid. Submit authorization request with diagnosis, conservative therapy failure, contraindications ruled out. *(verified from source)*

2. **"Medicare denied - non-surgical decompression not covered"** (Medicare) - Fix: **E0941 has LIMITED Medicare coverage** - non-surgical spinal decompression often NOT covered. Verify coverage with Medicare before ordering. If denied, patient responsible for cost or consider alternative covered treatments (PT, cervical traction E0860). *(verified from source)*

3. **"Contraindications not ruled out"** - Fix: Document contraindications ruled out: **cardiovascular conditions screened** (hypertension, heart disease), **eye conditions screened** (glaucoma, retinal issues), pregnancy excluded, severe osteoporosis excluded. Include screening results and physician clearance. *(verified from source)*

4. **"Conservative therapy failure not documented"** - Fix: Document conservative therapy failure: PT trial (duration, outcome), medications tried (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants), other therapies attempted (manual therapy, injections), why standard treatments inadequate. Minimum 4-6 weeks conservative therapy typically required. *(verified from source)*

5. **"F26 rental billing error"** (Medicaid) - Fix: E0941 is F26 continuous monthly rental at $1.73/day. Bill as monthly rental, not purchase. Verify rental rate correct. *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **LIMITED COVERAGE - verify before ordering** *(verified from source)*
- Non-surgical decompression often NOT covered by Medicare *(verified from source)*
- Special coverage instructions apply *(verified from source)*
- If Medicare denies, discuss alternative covered treatments with patient
- May need to bill patient directly if not covered

**NY Medicaid:**
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED - obtain FIRST** *(verified from source)*
- **F26 continuous monthly rental** at $1.73/day *(verified from source)*
- **Conservative therapy failure documented** *(verified from source)*
- Specific diagnosis - radiculopathy, disc herniation, stenosis *(verified from source)*
- **Contraindications ruled out** - cardiovascular, eye conditions *(verified from source)*
- Ability to safely use device confirmed *(verified from source)*

**Conservative Therapy Documentation:**
- PT trial with duration and outcome
- Medications tried and response
- Other therapies attempted (injections, manual therapy)
- Why standard treatments inadequate
- Minimum 4-6 weeks trial typically

**Contraindication Screening (CRITICAL):**
- Cardiovascular: Blood pressure screening, cardiac history
- Eye conditions: Vision screening, glaucoma/retinal history
- Pregnancy: Ruled out for females of childbearing age
- Severe osteoporosis: Bone density consideration

## Related Codes

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Potential Category Miscategorization:**
- **E0941 may belong in M06A (Wheelchair Accessories)** if "one-arm drive" interpretation
- Current placement in DM21 (Traction Equipment) based on "Gravity assisted traction device" description
- Verify correct categorization and cross-reference with M06A wheelchair accessories
- **Note:** This may be different from manual wheelchair one-arm drive attachments

**Alternative Traction Devices:**
- **E0860** - Overdoor cervical traction - For cervical radiculopathy. Direct bill, no PA, F3 frequency. Medicare preferred device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0849** - Pneumatic cervical traction - For severe cervical cases. Medicaid PA required, F2 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0890/E0900** - Pelvic traction frames - For pelvic/lumbar conditions. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Conservative Treatment Alternatives (Often Covered by Medicare):**
- Physical therapy and manual therapy
- Cervical traction devices (E0860, E0856)
- Pain management interventions

**If M06A Relationship Confirmed:**
- Cross-reference M06A manual wheelchair accessories
- One-arm drive mechanisms for wheelchairs
- Manual wheelchair propulsion modifications


## Safety Considerations
**MUST rule out contraindications:**
- Cardiovascular disease
- Eye conditions (glaucoma, retinal detachment risk)
- Pregnancy
- Severe osteoporosis
