# E0890 - Bed-Attached Pelvic Traction Frame

## Clinical Overview
Traction frame attached to footboard for pelvic traction (Buck's, Russell's). For pelvic/hip fractures and lower back conditions requiring home traction.

**Coverage:** Direct bill both payers - no PA required
**Medicaid F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes for medically necessary home pelvic traction
**Requirements:** Specific traction type (Buck's, Russell's), treatment protocol

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
**Requirements:** Orthopedic/physiatry order, specific traction type, weight specifications, caregiver availability

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] Specific traction type documented (Buck's, Russell's, etc.)
- [ ] Weight specifications for traction force
- [ ] Caregiver availability confirmed
- [ ] Treatment duration estimated

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Specific traction type not documented"** - Fix: Document traction type (Buck's, Russell's) with clinical rationale. *(verified from source)*
2. **"Weight specifications missing"** - Fix: Document precise weight/force specifications for traction protocol. *(verified from source)*
3. **"Caregiver availability not confirmed"** - Fix: Document caregiver availability and training for home traction management. *(verified from source)*
4. **"F3 frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history - once per 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document specific traction type (Buck's, Russell's) *(verified from source)*
- Treatment protocol with weight specifications *(verified from source)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- **F3 frequency - verify once per 5 years** *(verified from source)*
- Orthopedic/physiatry order required *(verified from source)*
- **Specific traction type documented** *(verified from source)*
- **Weight specifications** *(verified from source)*
- **Caregiver availability confirmed** *(verified from source)*
