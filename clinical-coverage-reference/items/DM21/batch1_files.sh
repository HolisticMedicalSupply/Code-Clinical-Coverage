# E0840 - Cervical Traction Frame (Headboard-Attached)

## ğŸš¨ MEDICARE: NOT REASONABLE AND NECESSARY (E0860 Preferred)

## Clinical Overview
Cervical traction frame that attaches to headboard. **Medicare considers NOT reasonable and necessary** - over-door device (E0860) preferred due to cost-effectiveness and no proven clinical advantage for E0840.

**Key Issue:** Medicare will likely **deny** E0840 claims - **use E0860 (overdoor) instead**

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage
**NOT COVERED** - Medicare considers NOT reasonable and necessary
- E0860 (overdoor) is preferred device
- No proven clinical advantage for E0840
- Expect denials

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**Requirements:** Fiscal order, diagnosis, treatment plan, patient education

## Tips for Prescribers
**Medicare patients:** **Use E0860 (overdoor device) instead** - cost-effective, covered
**Medicaid patients:** E0840 allowed but E0860 may be better option
