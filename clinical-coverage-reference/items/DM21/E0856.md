# E0856 - Inflatable Cervical Collar Traction Device

## Clinical Overview
Cervical collar with inflatable air bladder for intermittent home cervical traction with adjustable pressure. For mild-moderate cervical conditions.

**Coverage:** Direct bill both Medicare and Medicaid - no PA required

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes under cervical traction LCD
**Requirements:** Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**Requirements:** Practitioner order, diagnosis, patient education on inflation/use
**Typical use:** After 1 month clinic treatment

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Code: "E0856 - Cervical traction device, cervical collar, with inflatable air bladder"**
- [ ] ICD-10: M54.12 (radiculopathy), S13.4 (cervical strain), M54.2 (cervicalgia)
- [ ] Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment documented
- [ ] Patient education on inflation/use completed
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Covered under cervical traction LCD
- [ ] Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment documented

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] Practitioner order
- [ ] Diagnosis documented
- [ ] Patient education on inflation/use documented
- [ ] Typically after 1 month clinic treatment

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Patient education not documented"** - Fix: Document patient education including: proper inflation technique, pressure adjustment, duration of use, safety precautions, when to discontinue. Include education date and patient comprehension. *(verified from source)*

2. **"Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment not documented"** (Medicare) - Fix: Document specific impairment requiring cervical traction: radiculopathy, cervical strain, cervicalgia. Include severity and functional impact. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Prescribed too early without conservative therapy trial"** - Fix: E0856 typically prescribed after 1 month clinic treatment. Document conservative therapy trial: PT, medications, clinic-based traction. If prescribing earlier, justify urgent medical need. *(verified from source)*

4. **"Diagnosis not appropriate for mild device"** - Fix: E0856 is for mild-moderate cervical conditions. If severe condition, consider E0849 or E0860 with greater force capability. Match device to diagnosis severity. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Covered under cervical traction LCD *(verified from source)*
- Document musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment *(verified from source)*
- Straightforward approval - direct bill, no PA

**NY Medicaid:**
- Direct bill - no PA required *(verified from source)*
- Practitioner order with diagnosis *(verified from source)*
- **Patient education critical** - document inflation/use training *(verified from source)*
- Typically after 1 month clinic treatment *(verified from source)*
- Consider after conservative therapy trial

**Patient Education Requirements:**
- Proper collar placement and fit *(Under Review)*
- Inflation technique using hand pump *(Under Review)*
- Appropriate pressure levels *(Under Review)*
- Duration of use (typically 15-20 minutes, 2-3x daily) *(Under Review)*
- Safety precautions - stop if pain increases *(Under Review)*
- Deflation and removal technique *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

- **E0860** - Overdoor cervical traction - For standard cervical traction. Preferred by Medicare for non-collar devices. F3 frequency (once per 5 years). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0855** - Portable cervical traction not requiring frame - Similar portable option but requires Medicaid PA, F2 frequency. More complex approval than E0856. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0849** - Pneumatic traction - For severe cases. Medicaid PA required, F2 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0830** - Ambulatory traction - For therapy outside home. DVS authorization, F4 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0942** - Cervical halter - May be used with other traction devices. DVS authorization for Medicaid. *(Under Review)*

**Code Selection:**
- **E0856** - For mild-moderate cervical conditions, simple home use, patient prefers portable collar
- **E0860** - For standard cervical traction with greater force capability
- **E0849/E0855** - For complex cases requiring PA
