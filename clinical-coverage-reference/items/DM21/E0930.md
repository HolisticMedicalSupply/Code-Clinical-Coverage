# E0930 - Free-Standing Fracture Frame

## Clinical Overview
Free-standing fracture frame for complex spinal/pelvic fractures when bed-attached not suitable. Requires adequate home space.

**Coverage:** Direct bill both payers - no PA required

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Medical necessity, fracture management plan

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**Requirements:** Orthopedic evaluation, fracture management plan, home assessment (space/safety), caregiver training

## Tips
**Home assessment critical** - ensure adequate space for free-standing unit
**Caregiver training** - proper setup and maintenance required

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

- [ ] **Code: "E0930 - Fracture frame, free standing"**
- [ ] ICD-10: S22.xxx (thoracic), S32.xxx (lumbar/pelvic)
- [ ] Orthopedic evaluation documenting complex fracture
- [ ] **Home assessment for space/safety**
- [ ] **Caregiver training documentation**
- [ ] **Why bed-attached (E0920) not suitable**

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Home assessment not completed"** - Fix: Document home assessment with space dimensions, safety verification for free-standing frame. *(verified from source)*
2. **"Bed-attached option not tried first"** - Fix: Document why E0920 (bed-attached) not suitable - bed incompatible, home setup requires free-standing. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **"Caregiver training not documented"** - Fix: Document caregiver training on setup, maintenance, safety monitoring. *(verified from source)*
4. **"Space inadequate for free-standing unit"** - Fix: Verify adequate space before ordering, document dimensions and clearances. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document medical necessity for complex fracture management
- Explain why free-standing required vs bed-attached

**NY Medicaid:**
- Direct bill - no PA required *(verified from source)*
- **Home assessment CRITICAL** - space, safety *(verified from source)*
- **Caregiver training required** *(verified from source)*
- Orthopedic evaluation with fracture management plan *(verified from source)*

## Related Codes

- **E0920** - Bed-attached fracture frame with weights - Try first if bed suitable *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0880/E0900** - Free-standing simpler traction (extremity/pelvic) *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0870/E0890** - Bed-attached simpler traction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
