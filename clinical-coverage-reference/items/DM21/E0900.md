# E0900 - Free-Standing Pelvic Traction Stand (Buck's)

## Clinical Overview
Free-standing traction stand for pelvic traction (e.g., Buck's traction). For pelvic/hip/femur fractures and lumbar radiculopathy when bed-attached frame not suitable.

**Coverage:** Direct bill both payers - no PA required
**Medicaid F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Medical necessity documentation, traction protocol

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
**Requirements:** Orthopedic evaluation, specific traction protocol, weight/force specifications, home setup verification

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] Specific traction protocol (Buck's, etc.)
- [ ] Weight/force specifications
- [ ] Home setup verification (space for free-standing unit)
- [ ] Why bed-attached frame not suitable

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Home assessment not completed"** - Fix: Document home setup verification with space for free-standing unit. *(verified from source)*
2. **"Bed-attached not tried or inadequacy not justified"** - Fix: Document why E0890 (bed-attached) not suitable. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **"F3 frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history - once per 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
4. **"Traction protocol not specific"** - Fix: Document specific traction protocol (Buck's, etc.) with weight/force specs. *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document medical necessity for pelvic traction
- Explain why free-standing required vs bed-attached

**NY Medicaid:**
- **F3 frequency - verify once per 5 years** *(verified from source)*
- Orthopedic evaluation required *(verified from source)*
- **Specific traction protocol** *(verified from source)*
- **Weight/force specifications** *(verified from source)*
- **Home setup verification** - space, stability *(verified from source)*
