# E0920 - Bed-Attached Fracture Frame with Weights

## Clinical Overview
Fracture frame attached to bed with included weights for complex multi-point traction. For complex spinal/pelvic fractures and post-surgical stabilization.

**Coverage:** Direct bill both payers - no PA required

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Orthopedic surgical note, traction protocol

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**Requirements:** Orthopedic surgical note, specific fracture configuration, traction protocol with weight specifications, expected duration

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

- [ ] **Code: "E0920 - Fracture frame, attached to bed, includes weights"**
- [ ] ICD-10: S32.0xx (vertebral), S32.810x (pelvic ring fracture)
- [ ] **Orthopedic surgical note** documenting complex fracture
- [ ] **Specific fracture configuration**
- [ ] **Traction protocol with weight specifications**
- [ ] Expected duration

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Orthopedic surgical note missing"** - Fix: Include orthopedic surgical note documenting complex fracture requiring multi-point traction. *(verified from source)*
2. **"Traction protocol inadequate or missing weight specs"** - Fix: Document comprehensive traction protocol with specific weight specifications for each traction point. *(verified from source)*
3. **"Fracture configuration not specific"** - Fix: Document specific fracture configuration requiring multi-point weighted traction vs simpler frames. *(verified from source)*
4. **"Bed-attached frame not compatible"** - Fix: If bed incompatible, order E0930 (free-standing) instead and document why. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **Orthopedic surgical note required** *(verified from source)*
- Document complex fracture requiring multi-point traction *(Under Review)*
- **Traction protocol with weight specifications** *(verified from source)*
- Expected duration documented *(verified from source)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Direct bill - no PA required *(verified from source)*
- **Orthopedic surgical note** *(verified from source)*
- **Specific fracture configuration** *(verified from source)*
- **Traction protocol with weights** *(verified from source)*

## Related Codes

- **E0930** - Free-standing fracture frame - When bed attachment not feasible *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0870/E0890** - Simpler traction frames (extremity/pelvic) - For single-point traction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0880/E0900** - Free-standing simpler frames *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
