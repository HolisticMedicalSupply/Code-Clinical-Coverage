# E0945 - Extremity Traction Belt/Harness (Accessory)

## Clinical Overview
Extremity belt/harness accessory for use with extremity traction devices. Attachment component for lower extremity traction systems.

**Coverage:** Covered both payers as accessory to covered extremity traction device
**Medicaid:** DVS authorization, F3 (once per 5 years)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes as accessory to covered extremity traction device
**Requirements:** Active extremity traction prescription on file

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization
**F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
**Pricing:** Rental $0.15/day or purchase $45.09
**Requirements:** Active extremity traction prescription, anatomical specifications, proper fit/application training documented

## Prescription Requirements
- [ ] Active extremity traction device documented (E0870, E0880)
- [ ] Anatomical specifications (which extremity, patient measurements)
- [ ] Proper fit and application training documented

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Accessory billed without active extremity traction device"** - Fix: **Document active extremity traction device code** (E0870 or E0880) currently in use. Include device date of service and prescription. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: **Obtain DVS authorization (#) BEFORE ordering E0945.** All extremity traction accessories require DVS authorization for NY Medicaid. *(verified from source)*

3. **"F3 frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history. F3 = once per 5 years. If replacing within 5 years, document medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Anatomical specifications missing"** - Fix: Document anatomical specifications: which extremity (right/left leg), patient measurements (thigh/calf circumference), harness size, proper fit/application. *(verified from source)*

5. **"Proper fit/application training not documented"** - Fix: Document patient/caregiver training on harness application, positioning, circulation checks, skin integrity monitoring. *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document active extremity traction prescription *(verified from source)*
- Specify which traction device (E0870 or E0880) harness will be used with

**NY Medicaid:**
