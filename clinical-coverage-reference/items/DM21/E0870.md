# E0870 - Bed-Attached Extremity Traction Frame

## Clinical Overview
Traction frame attached to footboard for extremity traction (e.g., Buck's traction). For lower extremity fractures requiring home immobilization/stabilization.

**Coverage:** Direct bill both Medicare and Medicaid - no PA required
**Typical use:** Short-term post-fracture or post-surgical

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes as DME when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Orthopedic evaluation, treatment plan

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**Requirements:** Orthopedic evaluation, fracture type/location, treatment plan, expected duration

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Code: "E0870 - Traction frame, attached to footboard, extremity traction"**
- [ ] ICD-10: S72.xxx (femur), S82.xxx (tibia/fibula), S72.0xx (hip fracture)
- [ ] Orthopedic evaluation documenting fracture
- [ ] Fracture type and location specified
- [ ] Treatment plan with traction protocol
- [ ] Expected duration of traction use
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Medical necessity for home traction documented
- [ ] Why hospital discharge with home traction appropriate

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] Orthopedic evaluation documented
- [ ] Fracture classification clear
- [ ] Treatment plan comprehensive

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Bed-attached frame not compatible with patient's bed"** - Frame cannot attach to patient's specific bed type. Fix: Verify bed compatibility before ordering. If incompatible bed, order **E0880 (free-standing)** instead and document why bed attachment not feasible. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Medical necessity not established for home traction"** - Unclear why patient needs traction at home. Fix: Document medical necessity: patient stable for discharge, fracture requires ongoing traction, patient/caregiver capable, orthopedic follow-up plan established. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Treatment plan and expected duration not provided"** - Missing traction protocol. Fix: Document traction type (Buck's), weight specifications, expected duration (weeks to months), follow-up schedule. *(verified from source)*

4. **"Orthopedic evaluation missing"** - No orthopedic documentation. Fix: Include orthopedic evaluation with fracture diagnosis, classification, treatment rationale for traction. *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document orthopedic evaluation clearly *(verified from source)*
- Establish medical necessity for home traction *(Under Review)*
- Provide treatment plan with expected duration *(verified from source)*
- Typically short-term use (weeks to months) *(verified from source)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- Direct bill - straightforward approval, no PA *(verified from source)*
- Orthopedic evaluation with fracture type/location *(verified from source)*
- Treatment plan with expected duration *(verified from source)*

**Bed Compatibility:**
- Verify patient's bed has suitable footboard *(Under Review)*
- If bed incompatible, use **E0880 (free-standing)** instead *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

**Alternative to E0870:**
- **E0880** - Free-standing extremity traction stand - When bed attachment not feasible. Medicaid F3 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Pelvic Traction (Different Anatomy):**
- **E0890** - Pelvic traction frame (bed-attached) - For pelvic/hip fractures. Medicaid F3 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0900** - Free-standing pelvic traction stand - Medicaid F3 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Complex Fracture Frames:**
- **E0920** - Fracture frame attached to bed with weights - For complex multi-point traction. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0930** - Free-standing fracture frame - For complex fractures. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Traction Accessories:**
- **E0944** - Pelvic belt/harness - Accessory for pelvic traction devices. *(Under Review)*
- **E0945** - Extremity belt/harness - Accessory for extremity traction. *(Under Review)*

**Code Selection:**
- **E0870 (bed-attached)** - First-line when patient has compatible bed
- **E0880 (free-standing)** - When bed incompatible
- **E0890/E0900** - For pelvic traction (not extremity)
