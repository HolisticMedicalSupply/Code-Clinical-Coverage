**Coverage:** Covered both payers as accessory to covered pelvic traction device
**Medicaid:** DVS authorization, F3 (once per 5 years)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare

**Requirements:** Active pelvic traction prescription on file

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization
**F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
**Pricing:** Rental $0.18/day or purchase $54.90
**Requirements:** Active pelvic traction order, size/fit specifications, replacement need if applicable

## Prescription Requirements
- [ ] Active pelvic traction device documented (E0890, E0900)
- [ ] Size/fit specifications

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Accessory billed without active pelvic traction device"** - Fix: **Document active pelvic traction device code** (E0890 or E0900) currently in use. Include device date of service and prescription. Harness must be used with covered traction device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: **Obtain DVS authorization (#) BEFORE ordering E0944.** All pelvic traction accessories require DVS authorization for NY Medicaid. *(verified from source)*

3. **"F3 frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history. F3 = once per 5 years. If replacing within 5 years, document medical necessity: wear/tear, patient size change, hygiene concerns. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Size/fit specifications missing"** - Fix: Document size/fit specifications: patient measurements (hip circumference, thigh circumference), harness/boot size selected, anatomical fit verification. *(verified from source)*
