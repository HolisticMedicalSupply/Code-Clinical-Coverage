# E0946 - Dual Fracture Frame with Cross Bars (Balkan/Four Poster)

## ðŸš¨ MEDICAID: PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED

## Clinical Overview
Dual fracture frame with cross bars (Balkan or Four Poster configuration) for complex fractures requiring multi-directional traction. More complex than standard frames.

**Medicaid:** **PA REQUIRED**, F3 (once per 5 years rental)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Medical necessity, complex fracture documentation

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with PA
**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years rental
- Surgical/orthopedic note detailing fracture complexity
- Specific frame configuration needed (Balkan vs Four Poster)
- Traction protocol
- Home setup feasibility assessment

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] **Complex fracture classification documented**
- [ ] **Specific frame configuration specified** (Balkan or Four Poster)
- [ ] Traction protocol with multi-directional requirements
- [ ] Home setup feasibility (space, caregiver availability)
- [ ] Why simpler fracture frame (E0920, E0930) inadequate
