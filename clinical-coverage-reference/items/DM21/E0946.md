# E0946 - Dual Fracture Frame with Cross Bars (Balkan/Four Poster)

## ðŸš¨ MEDICAID: PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED

## Clinical Overview
Dual fracture frame with cross bars (Balkan or Four Poster configuration) for complex fractures requiring multi-directional traction. More complex than standard frames.

**Medicaid:** **PA REQUIRED**, F3 (once per 5 years rental)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Medical necessity, complex fracture documentation

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with PA
**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years rental
- Surgical/orthopedic note detailing fracture complexity
- Specific frame configuration needed (Balkan vs Four Poster)
- Traction protocol
- Home setup feasibility assessment

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] **Complex fracture classification documented**
- [ ] **Specific frame configuration specified** (Balkan or Four Poster)
- [ ] Traction protocol with multi-directional requirements
- [ ] Home setup feasibility (space, caregiver availability)
- [ ] Why simpler fracture frame (E0920, E0930) inadequate

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Prior approval not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: **Obtain Medicaid PA BEFORE ordering E0946.** Submit PA request with surgical/orthopedic note, fracture complexity documentation, specific frame configuration (Balkan vs Four Poster), traction protocol. *(verified from source)*

2. **"Fracture complexity not justified"** - Fix: Document why dual crossbar frame needed vs simpler fracture frames (E0920, E0930). Include: multi-directional traction requirements, fracture pattern requiring complex stabilization, why simpler frame inadequate. *(verified from source)*

3. **"Specific frame configuration not documented"** - Fix: Specify Balkan frame or Four Poster configuration with clinical rationale. Document which configuration suits patient's fracture pattern and home setup. *(verified from source)*

4. **"Home setup feasibility not assessed"** - Fix: Document home assessment: adequate space for dual frame with cross bars, ceiling height clearance, floor stability, caregiver availability for complex setup. *(verified from source)*

5. **"F3 frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history. F3 = once per 5 years rental. If within 5 years, justify medical necessity. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document complex fracture requiring multi-directional traction *(Under Review)*
- Explain why dual crossbar configuration medically necessary
- Surgical/orthopedic note with fracture complexity

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Submit PA early** - allow processing time *(verified from source)*
- **F3 frequency - once per 5 years rental** *(verified from source)*
- **Surgical/orthopedic note detailing fracture complexity** *(verified from source)*
- **Specific frame configuration** (Balkan vs Four Poster) *(verified from source)*
- **Traction protocol** with multi-directional requirements *(verified from source)*
- **Home setup feasibility assessment** *(verified from source)*

## Related Codes

**Simpler Fracture Frames (Consider First):**
- **E0920** - Bed-attached fracture frame with weights - For complex fractures, simpler than E0946 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0930** - Free-standing fracture frame - Simpler than E0946 *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Other Complex Attachments:**
- **E0947** - Fracture frame attachment for complex pelvic traction - PA required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0948** - Fracture frame attachment for complex cervical traction - PA required *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Standard Traction Frames:**
- **E0870/E0880** - Extremity traction frames *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0890/E0900** - Pelvic traction frames *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
