# E0860 - Overdoor Cervical Traction (PREFERRED DEVICE)

## âœ… PREFERRED DEVICE - Cost-Effective, Well-Covered

## Clinical Overview
Overdoor cervical traction - **PREFERRED device** for home cervical traction. Medicare considers most cost-effective option with no proven clinical advantage for more complex devices *(Under Review - High Confidence)*.

**Key Advantage:** Well-covered both payers, cost-effective, straightforward *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**COVERED - PREFERRED DEVICE**
**Requirements:** Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment, demonstrated appropriate use

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
**Requirements:** Fiscal order, diagnosis, patient/caregiver training *(Under Review - High Confidence)*, typically after conservative therapy trial *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Code: "E0860 - Traction equipment, overdoor, cervical"**
- [ ] ICD-10: M50.121-M50.123 (cervical disc with radiculopathy), M54.2 (cervicalgia), M47.812 (spondylosis), S13.4 (cervical strain)
- [ ] Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment requiring cervical traction
- [ ] Demonstrated appropriate use capability
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment documented
- [ ] Demonstrated appropriate use
- [ ] Written order before delivery

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] Signed fiscal order
- [ ] Diagnosis code documented
- [ ] Patient/caregiver training documented
- [ ] Typically after conservative therapy trial

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment not documented"** (Medicare) - Fix: Document specific musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment requiring cervical traction: cervical disc herniation with radiculopathy, cervicalgia, cervical spondylosis, cervical strain. Include diagnosis code, symptom severity, functional limitations. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"Demonstrated appropriate use not documented"** (Medicare) - Fix: Document patient has been instructed on and demonstrates appropriate use of overdoor cervical traction: proper setup, halter application, weight/force adjustment, positioning, duration. Include demonstration date and patient competency. *(verified from source)*

3. **"Patient/caregiver training not documented"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Document comprehensive training for patient/caregiver including: overdoor attachment setup, halter fit and application, weight adjustment for appropriate force, proper positioning, duration per session, safety precautions, warning signs. Include training date and comprehension assessment. *(verified from source)*

4. **"Conservative therapy not tried first"** - Fix: E0860 typically prescribed after conservative therapy trial. Document: PT, medications, manual therapy, why cervical traction now indicated. If prescribing as first-line, justify immediate medical necessity (acute radiculopathy, post-injury). *(verified from source)*

5. **"Fiscal order not signed or diagnosis missing"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Ensure fiscal order signed by practitioner with complete diagnosis code documented before delivery. *(verified from source)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- **E0860 is PREFERRED device** - easiest approval for cervical traction *(verified from source)*
- Document musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment clearly *(verified from source)*
- Demonstrated appropriate use required *(verified from source)*
- Written order before delivery *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- Cost-effective, well-covered, no PA required *(Under Review)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Direct bill - no PA required** *(verified from source)*
- **F3 frequency - once per 5 years** *(verified from source)*
- Signed fiscal order with diagnosis *(verified from source)*
- **Patient/caregiver training critical** - document comprehensively *(verified from source)*
- Typically after conservative therapy trial *(verified from source)*
- Simple approval process compared to E0849/E0855 (no PA)

**Patient/Caregiver Training Requirements:**
- Overdoor attachment - proper placement, secure mounting *(Under Review)*
- Halter application - proper fit, comfortable positioning *(Under Review)*
- Weight adjustment - start low (5-10 lbs), gradually increase as tolerated *(Under Review)*
- Proper positioning - seated, slight neck flexion *(Under Review)*
- Duration - typically 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times daily *(Under Review)*
- Safety - stop if increased pain, numbness, dizziness *(Under Review)*
- Maintenance - inspect equipment, replace worn components *(Under Review)*

**Why E0860 is Preferred (Medicare Policy):**
- Cost-effective compared to E0840/E0850 free-standing devices *(verified from source)*
- Simple home setup - attaches to any standard door *(Under Review)*
- No proven clinical advantage for more complex devices *(verified from source)*
- Direct bill both payers, no PA, straightforward approval *(Under Review)*
- First-line choice for home cervical traction *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Related Codes

**Devices Medicare Does NOT Cover (Use E0860 Instead):**
- **E0840** - Headboard-attached frame - Medicare NOT covered. Use E0860 instead. Medicaid covered but E0860 preferred. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0850** - Free-standing stand - Medicare NOT covered. Use E0860 instead. Medicaid covered but must justify why overdoor inadequate. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**More Complex Devices (When E0860 Inadequate):**
- **E0849** - Free-standing pneumatic cervical traction - For severe cases requiring greater pneumatic force. Medicaid PA required, F2 frequency (twice per lifetime). Use when E0860 inadequate for severe conditions. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0855** - Cervical traction not requiring stand/frame - Portable home devices. Medicaid PA required, F2 frequency. More complex approval than E0860. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Simpler/Portable Options:**
- **E0856** - Inflatable cervical collar traction - Simple portable collar for mild-moderate conditions. Direct bill, no PA. Alternative to E0860 for less severe cases. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0830** - Ambulatory traction device - For ongoing therapy outside home. Medicaid DVS authorization, F4 frequency (once per 3 years). Different use case than home-based E0860. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Traction Accessories:**
- **E0942** - Cervical head harness/halter - Accessory for cervical traction devices including E0860. Replacement halters or initial issue. DVS authorization required for NY Medicaid. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0948** - Fracture frame attachment - For complex cervical traction setups. *(Under Review)*

**Code Selection Guidance:**
- **E0860 (overdoor)** - FIRST-LINE choice for home cervical traction (Medicare preferred, simple approval)
- **E0856 (inflatable collar)** - For mild-moderate conditions, patient prefers portable collar
- **E0849 (pneumatic)** - For severe cases when E0860 inadequate (requires Medicaid PA)
- **E0840/E0850** - Medicare NOT covered; if Medicaid patient requires these, must justify why E0860 inadequate
- **E0830 (ambulatory)** - For therapy outside home (different use case than E0860)
