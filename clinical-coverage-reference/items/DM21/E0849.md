# E0849 - Free-Standing Pneumatic Cervical Traction

## ðŸš¨ MEDICAID: PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED

## Clinical Overview
Free-standing pneumatic cervical traction for severe cases requiring greater traction force with pneumatic control. More complex than standard devices.

**Medicaid:** **PA REQUIRED**, F2 (twice per lifetime rental)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes with additional criteria
**Requirements:** Specific diagnosis, traction force needs documented

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with PA
**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **F2 frequency:** Twice per lifetime rental
- **Must document failure/inadequacy of simpler devices (E0860)**
- Order with specific force requirements

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] **Document E0860 (overdoor) trial failure**
- [ ] **Specific traction force requirements**
- [ ] Severe cervical radiculopathy or post-surgical status
- [ ] Why pneumatic control needed
