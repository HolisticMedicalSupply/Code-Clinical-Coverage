# E0849 - Free-Standing Pneumatic Cervical Traction

## ðŸš¨ MEDICAID: PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED

## Clinical Overview

E0849 represents a free-standing pneumatic cervical traction device for severe cervical conditions requiring greater traction force with pneumatic controlled application. This is a more complex device than standard cervical traction equipment (E0860, E0856), designed for patients with cervical disc herniation with radiculopathy, severe cervical radiculopathy, or post-cervical surgery who require greater pneumatic-controlled traction force.

**CRITICAL COVERAGE NOTE:** NY Medicaid requires **PRIOR APPROVAL** and has strict F2 frequency limits (twice per lifetime rental). Must document failure or inadequacy of simpler devices (E0860) before approval. Medicare covered with additional criteria beyond standard cervical traction. *(verified from source)*

**Device Complexity:** E0849 is more complex than basic over-door or collar traction devices due to pneumatic control system allowing precise force application. Used when simpler devices inadequate for patient's condition.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes with additional criteria
**Requirements:** Specific diagnosis, traction force needs documented

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with PA
**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **F2 frequency:** Twice per lifetime rental
- **Must document failure/inadequacy of simpler devices (E0860)**
- Order with specific force requirements

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Code: "E0849 - Cervical traction equipment, free-standing, pneumatic"**
- [ ] ICD-10: M50.121-M50.123 (cervical disc with radiculopathy), M54.12 (radiculopathy), Z98.1 (post-surgical)
- [ ] **Document E0860 (overdoor) trial failure or inadequacy**
- [ ] **Specific traction force requirements** - why greater force needed
- [ ] **Why pneumatic control necessary** vs. manual traction devices
- [ ] Severe cervical condition requiring advanced traction therapy
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] Specific diagnosis documented (disc herniation with radiculopathy, post-surgical)
- [ ] Traction force needs justified - why E0860 inadequate
- [ ] Additional criteria beyond standard cervical traction documented
- [ ] Medical necessity for pneumatic device vs. simpler options

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] **PRIOR APPROVAL obtained BEFORE ordering** (critical)
- [ ] **DVS authorization obtained**
- [ ] **F2 frequency verified** - twice per lifetime rental (check patient history)
- [ ] **E0860 trial documented** - dates, duration, outcome showing inadequacy
- [ ] Specific force requirements documented with clinical justification
- [ ] Fiscal order signed

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Prior approval not obtained"** (Medicaid) - E0849 ordered/delivered without prior approval. Fix: **Obtain Medicaid prior approval BEFORE ordering E0849.** Submit prior approval request with comprehensive documentation: diagnosis, E0860 trial failure, specific force requirements, why pneumatic device necessary. Wait for approval confirmation before ordering. *(verified from source)*

2. **"E0860 trial failure not documented"** (Medicaid) - No documentation showing simpler device (E0860 overdoor) tried and found inadequate. Fix: **Document E0860 trial first** before requesting E0849. Include: E0860 trial dates, duration (typically 2-4 weeks), patient compliance, outcome (inadequate symptom relief, insufficient force), specific reasons why E0860 inadequate. *(verified from source)*

3. **"Specific force requirements not justified"** - Request for pneumatic device without documented force needs. Fix: Document specific traction force requirements with clinical justification: typical force needed (e.g., 25-30 lbs), why greater force necessary for patient's condition, inability to achieve therapeutic effect with E0860's force range, pneumatic control needed for precise force application. *(verified from source)*

4. **"F2 frequency exceeded - second lifetime rental already used"** (Medicaid) - Patient already received E0849 twice (F2 limit). Fix: Verify patient history before ordering. F2 frequency is **twice per lifetime rental** - very restrictive. If patient already used both rentals, claim will deny. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

5. **"Additional criteria not met - standard traction appropriate"** (Medicare) - E0849 requested but diagnosis doesn't support need for advanced pneumatic device. Fix: Document additional criteria justifying E0849 vs. standard traction: **severe** cervical disc herniation with radiculopathy, post-cervical surgery status with ongoing symptoms, failed conservative therapy including standard traction (E0860). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document specific diagnosis requiring advanced traction - severe disc herniation with radiculopathy, post-surgical *(verified from source)*
- Justify specific traction force needs beyond standard devices *(verified from source)*
- Explain why pneumatic control necessary vs. manual traction *(Under Review)*
- Include written order with comprehensive justification *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Submit prior approval request early** - allow processing time before patient needs device *(verified from source)*
- **Obtain DVS authorization** *(verified from source)*
- **Verify F2 frequency** - check patient history for prior E0849 rentals *(verified from source)*
- **Document E0860 trial failure comprehensively** - dates, duration, outcome, why inadequate *(verified from source)*
- **Specific force requirements with clinical justification** - relate to diagnosis severity *(verified from source)*
- Emphasize severity: disc herniation with radiculopathy, post-surgical, failed simpler devices *(Under Review)*

## Related Codes

**Simpler Cervical Traction Devices (Try First):**
- **E0860** - Overdoor cervical traction - **PREFERRED FIRST-LINE device** (Medicare). Must document E0860 trial failure before E0849 approval for Medicaid. Direct bill both payers, no PA, F3 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0856** - Inflatable cervical collar traction - Simple portable collar device. Direct bill, no PA. For mild-moderate cervical conditions. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Similar Complexity Devices:**
- **E0855** - Cervical traction equipment not requiring stand/frame - Also requires Medicaid PA, F2 frequency (twice per lifetime). Similar approval process to E0849. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Other Stationary Options:**
- **E0850** - Free-standing cervical traction stand - Free-standing but NOT pneumatic. Medicare NOT covered (prefers E0860). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0840** - Traction frame attached to headboard - Medicare NOT covered (prefers E0860). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0830** - Ambulatory traction device - Portable for therapy outside home. Medicaid DVS authorization, F4 frequency. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Traction Accessories:**
- **E0942** - Cervical head harness/halter - Accessory for cervical traction devices including E0849. DVS authorization required for NY Medicaid. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0948** - Fracture frame attachment - For complex cervical traction setups. *(Under Review)*
