# E0840 - Cervical Traction Frame (Headboard-Attached)

## ðŸš¨ MEDICARE: NOT REASONABLE AND NECESSARY (E0860 Preferred)

## Clinical Overview

E0840 is a cervical traction frame that attaches to a patient's headboard for home cervical traction therapy. Used for musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment requiring cervical traction including cervical disc disorders, cervical radiculopathy, cervicalgia, and cervical spondylosis.

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL MEDICARE COVERAGE ISSUE:** Medicare considers E0840 **NOT reasonable and necessary** - overdoor device (E0860) is the preferred device due to cost-effectiveness and no proven clinical advantage for E0840 over E0860. Medicare will likely **DENY** E0840 claims. *(verified from source)*

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use **E0860 (overdoor device) instead** for Medicare patients. For Medicaid patients, E0840 is covered (direct bill, no PA) but E0860 may still be a better cost-effective option.

## Coverage Details

### Medicare Coverage

**NOT COVERED** - Medicare considers NOT reasonable and necessary
- **E0860 (overdoor) is preferred device** *(verified from source)*
- **No proven clinical advantage for E0840** *(verified from source)*
- Expect denials for E0840 claims
- Medicare policy directs to E0860 as cost-effective alternative

### NY Medicaid (Nassau County)

**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA required
**Documentation Requirements:**
- Signed fiscal order within 30 days *(verified from source)*
- Diagnosis code documented *(verified from source)*
- Treatment plan *(verified from source)*
- Patient education on device use *(verified from source)*
- Patient demonstrates ability to tolerate device *(verified from source)*

**Important Notes:**
- Direct bill - no prior authorization required

- Consider E0860 as cost-effective alternative even though E0840 covered

### NY Medicaid (Brooklyn)

Coverage criteria identical to Nassau County. Direct bill, no PA required. Same documentation requirements apply.

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Code: "E0840 - Traction frame, attached to headboard, cervical"**
- [ ] ICD-10 diagnosis: M50.10-M50.13 (cervical disc disorder), M54.12 (radiculopathy), M54.2 (cervicalgia), M47.812 (cervical spondylosis)
- [ ] Document musculoskeletal/neurologic impairment requiring cervical traction
- [ ] Patient education on device use documented
- [ ] Patient demonstrates ability to tolerate device
- [ ] Physician signature, date, and NPI

**For Medicare:**
- [ ] **STOP - Medicare considers E0840 NOT covered**
- [ ] **Use E0860 (overdoor device) instead** - covered, cost-effective
- [ ] If patient specifically requires headboard-attached device, document exceptional circumstances
- [ ] Expect denial - discuss alternative E0860 with patient

**For NY Medicaid:**
- [ ] Signed fiscal order within 30 days
- [ ] Diagnosis documented
- [ ] Treatment plan documented
- [ ] Patient education on setup and use
- [ ] Patient ability to tolerate device assessed
- [ ] Consider E0860 as cost-effective alternative (still covered but simpler)

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"NOT reasonable and necessary"** (Medicare) - Medicare does not cover E0840 headboard-attached frames. Fix: **Use E0860 (overdoor cervical traction) instead** - Medicare's preferred device with proven cost-effectiveness. E0860 covered, direct bill both payers, F3 frequency. No clinical advantage documented for E0840 over E0860 per Medicare policy. *(verified from source)*

2. **"Patient education not documented"** (Medicaid) - No documentation showing patient received education on device setup, use, and safety. Fix: Document comprehensive patient education including: device attachment to headboard, proper halter application, traction force adjustment, duration of use, safety precautions, warning signs to discontinue. Include education date and patient understanding verification. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

3. **"Patient unable to tolerate device"** - Patient demonstrates intolerance or inability to use device safely during trial. Fix: Conduct device trial before prescribing. Document patient can tolerate cervical traction forces, understands proper positioning, and demonstrates safe independent use. If patient cannot tolerate E0840, consider alternative devices (E0860 overdoor, E0856 inflatable collar) with better tolerance profiles. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Fiscal order not signed within 30 days"** (Medicaid) - Order not signed within required timeframe. Fix: Ensure fiscal order signed within 30 days of delivery per Medicaid requirements. Verify date on order and delivery date. If order expired, obtain new signed fiscal order before delivery. *(verified from source)*

5. **"Treatment plan not documented"** (Medicaid) - Missing treatment plan for cervical traction therapy. Fix: Document comprehensive treatment plan including: diagnosis, cervical traction frequency (daily, BID, etc.), duration per session, expected therapy duration, goals (pain reduction, radiculopathy improvement), and plan for follow-up assessment. *(verified from source)*

## Related Codes

**Preferred Alternative to E0840:**
- **E0860** - Overdoor cervical traction - **PREFERRED DEVICE** (Medicare and cost-effective choice). Use instead of E0840 for Medicare patients. Covered both payers, direct bill, no PA, F3 frequency (once per 5 years). Attaches to door frame instead of headboard - simpler setup. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Other Stationary Cervical Traction Devices:**
- **E0850** - Free-standing cervical traction stand - Another stationary option. Medicare NOT covered (prefers E0860). Medicaid covered but must justify why overdoor inadequate. For patients requiring free-standing unit due to home setup limitations. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0849** - Free-standing pneumatic cervical traction - For severe cases requiring greater pneumatic-controlled force. Medicaid PA required, F2 frequency (twice per lifetime). More complex than E0840/E0860. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Portable/Simple Cervical Traction Options:**
- **E0856** - Inflatable cervical collar traction - Simple portable collar with inflatable bladder. Direct bill both payers, no PA. For mild-moderate cervical conditions. Alternative if patient cannot tolerate frame-based traction. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0855** - Cervical traction equipment not requiring stand/frame - Portable home-use devices. Medicaid PA required, F2 frequency (twice per lifetime). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0830** - Ambulatory traction device - Portable device for ongoing therapy outside home. Medicaid DVS authorization, F4 frequency (once per 3 years). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

**Traction Accessories:**
- **E0942** - Cervical head harness/halter - Accessory for cervical traction devices including E0840. Replacement halters or initial issue. DVS authorization required for NY Medicaid. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
- **E0948** - Fracture frame attachment - For complex cervical traction setups. *(Under Review)*

**Code Selection Guidance:**
- **Medicare patients:** Use **E0860 (overdoor)** - E0840 NOT covered
- **Medicaid patients:** E0840 covered BUT **consider E0860** as simpler, cost-effective alternative
- **Patients without suitable headboard:** Use E0860 (overdoor) or E0850 (free-standing)
- **Severe cases:** Consider E0849 (pneumatic) with PA for Medicaid
- **Portable needs:** Consider E0856 (collar) or E0830 (ambulatory)
