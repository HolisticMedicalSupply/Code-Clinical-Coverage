# E0948 - Complex Cervical Traction Attachment (Accessory)

## ðŸš¨ MEDICAID: PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED

## Clinical Overview
Specialized attachment for complex cervical traction - for cervical fractures, spine trauma, halo fixation preparation. More complex than standard cervical traction.

**Accessory:** Requires fracture frame on file (E0920, E0930, E0946)
**Medicaid:** **PA REQUIRED**, F3 (once per 5 years)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes as accessory to fracture frame when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Fracture frame on file, medical necessity

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with PA
**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
- Cervical fracture imaging (X-ray, CT, MRI)
- Neurosurgical/orthopedic evaluation
- Stability assessment
- Treatment plan with traction specifications

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] **Active fracture frame documented** (E0920, E0930, or E0946)
- [ ] **Cervical fracture imaging** (X-ray, CT, MRI) with radiologist report
- [ ] Fracture classification (Denis, AO/ASIF, etc.)
- [ ] Neurosurgical or orthopedic spine specialist evaluation
- [ ] Stability assessment (stable vs unstable fracture pattern)
- [ ] Treatment plan: pre-halo traction, definitive traction, etc.
- [ ] Traction force/weight specifications

## Safety Considerations
**Cervical spine trauma** - requires specialist evaluation
**Monitoring:** Neurological status, pain, alignment
