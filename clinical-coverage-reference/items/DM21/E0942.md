# E0942 - Cervical Traction Head Harness (Accessory)

## Clinical Overview
Cervical head harness/halter accessory for use with cervical traction devices. Initial issue or replacement component.

**Coverage:** Covered both payers as accessory to covered cervical traction device
**Medicaid:** DVS authorization, F3 (once per 5 years)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes as accessory to covered cervical traction device
**Requirements:** Active cervical traction prescription on file

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with DVS authorization
**F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
**Pricing:** Rental $0.09/day or purchase $20.57
**Requirements:** Active cervical traction device use, medical necessity for new/replacement, proper fitting documented

## Prescription Requirements
- [ ] Active cervical traction device documented (E0840, E0849, E0850, E0855, E0860)
- [ ] Medical necessity for new/replacement harness
- [ ] Proper fitting measurements/documentation

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Accessory billed without active cervical traction device"** - Fix: **Document active cervical traction device code** (E0840, E0849, E0850, E0855, or E0860) currently in use. Include device date of service and prescription. Harness must be used with covered traction device. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

2. **"DVS authorization not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: **Obtain DVS authorization (#) BEFORE ordering E0942.** All cervical traction accessories require DVS authorization for NY Medicaid. Submit authorization with active traction device documentation. *(verified from source)*

3. **"F3 frequency exceeded - replacement within 5 years"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history. F3 = once per 5 years. If <5 years since last E0942, justify medical necessity for early replacement: excessive wear, patient size change, device failure, hygiene/infection concerns. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

4. **"Proper fitting not documented"** - Fix: Document proper fitting measurements: head circumference, chin-to-occipital distance, harness size selected. Include fitting date and patient comfort/tolerance verification. *(verified from source)*

5. **"Replacement not medically necessary within RUL"** - Fix: Document medical necessity for replacement if within reasonable useful lifetime (typically 5 years). Document: excessive wear/deterioration, hygiene issues, patient weight/size change making current harness unsafe. *(Under Review)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document active cervical traction prescription *(verified from source)*
- Specify which traction device (E0840-E0860) harness will be used with
- Justify replacement if previous harness still within RUL

**NY Medicaid:**
- **DVS authorization REQUIRED** *(verified from source)*
- **F3 frequency - once per 5 years** *(verified from source)*
- Active cervical traction device use documented *(verified from source)*
- **Proper fitting documented** - measurements and size *(verified from source)*
- Rental ($0.09/day) or purchase ($20.57) option *(verified from source)*

**Replacement Documentation:**
- Document wear/deterioration if replacing within 5 years
- Patient size change justification
- Hygiene or infection control concerns
- Device failure or malfunction
