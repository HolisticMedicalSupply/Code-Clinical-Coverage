# E0947 - Complex Pelvic Traction Attachment (Accessory)

## ðŸš¨ MEDICAID: PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED

## Clinical Overview
Specialized attachment for complex pelvic traction - multi-point pelvic stabilization for unstable pelvic ring injuries and acetabular fractures.

**Accessory:** Requires fracture frame on file (E0920, E0930, E0946)
**Medicaid:** **PA REQUIRED**, F3 (once per 5 years)

## Coverage Details

### Medicare
**Covered:** Yes as accessory to fracture frame when medically necessary
**Requirements:** Fracture frame on file, medical necessity

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes with PA
**Requirements:**
- **PRIOR APPROVAL REQUIRED**
- **F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
- Complex pelvic fracture classification (Young-Burgess, Tile, etc.)
- Orthopedic surgical plan
- Specific attachment specifications
- Weight/force requirements

## Prescription Checklist
- [ ] **Active fracture frame documented** (E0920, E0930, or E0946)
- [ ] **Complex pelvic fracture classification**
- [ ] Unstable pelvic ring or acetabular fracture documented
- [ ] Orthopedic surgical plan with traction specifications
- [ ] Multi-point stabilization requirements
- [ ] Weight/force specifications for each traction point

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Prior approval not obtained"** (Medicaid) - Fix: **Obtain Medicaid PA BEFORE ordering E0947.** Submit PA with complex pelvic fracture classification, orthopedic surgical plan, attachment specifications, weight/force requirements. *(verified from source)*

2. **"Accessory billed without fracture frame"** - Fix: **Document active fracture frame code** (E0920, E0930, or E0946) on file. Attachment must be used with fracture frame. Include frame date of service. *(verified from source)*

3. **"Complex pelvic fracture not documented"** - Fix: Document complex pelvic fracture classification (Young-Burgess, Tile, AO/OTA): unstable pelvic ring, multiple pelvic fractures, acetabular fracture. Explain why multi-point pelvic stabilization needed. *(verified from source)*

4. **"Attachment specifications not detailed"** - Fix: Document specific attachment specifications: which pelvic attachment points, force vectors, weight/force requirements for each point, how attachment integrates with frame. *(verified from source)*

5. **"F3 frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history. F3 = once per 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*

## Tips for Approval

**Medicare:**
- Document fracture frame on file (E0920, E0930, or E0946) *(verified from source)*
- Complex pelvic fracture requiring specialized attachment
- Medical necessity for multi-point pelvic stabilization

**NY Medicaid:**
- **Submit PA early** *(verified from source)*
- **F3 frequency - once per 5 years** *(verified from source)*
- **Complex pelvic fracture classification** (Young-Burgess, Tile) *(verified from source)*
- **Orthopedic surgical plan** *(verified from source)*
- **Specific attachment specifications** *(verified from source)*
- **Weight/force requirements** for each traction point *(verified from source)*
- Active fracture frame documented
