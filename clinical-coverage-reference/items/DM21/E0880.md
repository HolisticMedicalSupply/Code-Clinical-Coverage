**Requirements:** Medical necessity documentation

### NY Medicaid
**Covered:** Yes - direct bill, no PA
**F3 frequency:** Once per 5 years
**Requirements:** Orthopedic order, fracture classification, home assessment (adequate space), caregiver training

## Tips

**Caregiver training** - required for safe operation

## Prescription Checklist for Physicians

**Required Elements:**
- [ ] Patient demographics and insurance ID
- [ ] **Code: "E0880 - Traction stand, free standing, extremity traction"**
- [ ] ICD-10: S72.xxx, S82.xxx, S72.0xx
- [ ] Orthopedic order with fracture classification
- [ ] **Home assessment - adequate space documented**
- [ ] **Caregiver training plan**
- [ ] **Why bed-attached (E0870) not feasible**

## Common Denial Reasons

1. **"Home assessment not completed"** - Fix: Document home assessment with space, stability, safety verification. *(verified from source)*
2. **"F3 frequency exceeded"** (Medicaid) - Fix: Verify patient history - once per 5 years. *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
3. **"Bed-attached not tried first"** - Fix: Document why E0870 not suitable (bed incompatible, home setup). *(Under Review - High Confidence)*
4. **"Caregiver training not documented"** - Fix: Document comprehensive caregiver training on setup, safety. *(verified from source)*
