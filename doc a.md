Document measurements and conservative therapy failure. **E0675 Pneumatic compression device, high-pressure:** - Indications: Advanced lymphedema (Stage 3) requiring higher pressures. - Requirements: Document: (1) Failed standard pressure devices, (2) Stage 3 lymphedema with fibrosis, (3) Physician prescription specifying high pressure need, (4) Pressure settings documented. Usually 60-80 mmHg vs standard 30-50 mmHg. **E0676 Intermittent limb compression device, compression cycle timing only:** - Indications: Device with timing control but no pressure calibration. - Requirements: Justify why this specific type needed. Usually lower reimbursement. ### VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY COVERAGE (Secondary indication): **Coverage requirements:** (1) Chronic venous insufficiency diagnosis (I87.2), (2) **Active venous stasis ulcer present** (NOT just insufficiency), (3) Failed 4-6 months conservative: compression stockings 30-40 mmHg worn daily, leg elevation, Unna boot or multi-layer compression bandaging, (4) Ulcer not improving despite conservative therapy, (5) Venous studies documenting insufficiency (duplex ultrasound), (6) Prescription including treatment plan. **NOT COVERED for venous insufficiency:** Edema alone, varicose veins without ulcer, DVT prevention, post-phlebitic syndrome without ulcer. ### SUPPLIES: **E0658 Replacement garment for pneumatic compression device:** - Indications: Replace worn/damaged garment. - Requirements: Document date of original garment. Replacement frequency: 6-12 months reasonable. RT/LT modifier if applicable. **E0659 Calibrated gradient sequential compression appliance (garment):** - Indications: Replacement for calibrated gradient system. - Requirements: Same as E0658 but for gradient devices. **E0667 Replacement accessories for pneumatic compression device (not garment/appliance):** - Indications: Tubing, connectors, inflation devices. - Requirements: Specify component replaced. Frequency based on wear/malfunction. **A4600 Sleeve for intermittent limb compression device (replacement):** - Indications: Replacement sleeve only (not full garment). - Requirements: Document what needs replacing. RT/LT modifier if applicable. **DOCUMENTATION CHECKLIST (Critical for audit defense):** 1. Diagnosis code with lymphedema or venous insufficiency 2. Stage/severity (circumference measurements at multiple points for lymphedema; ulcer size/location for venous) 3. **Conservative therapy documentation:** What was tried (compression garments, elevation, exercise), Duration (4-6 months minimum), Frequency of compliance, Results (lack of improvement or progression) 4. Physician evaluation notes supporting device need 5. Prescription specifying: Device type, Affected limb(s), Pressure settings, Frequency/duration of daily use, Treatment goals 6. Follow-up plan with frequency 7. For venous ulcers: Ulcer measurements and photos at baseline and follow-up 8. Patient education documented: Device use instructions, Frequency compliance, Ongoing compression garment use when not using device **MEDICARE AUDITS:** Pneumatic compression devices flagged for high improper payments. Audit focus: Insufficient documentation of conservative therapy failure (82% of denials), Lack of measurements/staging, Missing physician evaluation, Venous insufficiency without ulcer (not covered). Keep complete records including: Dated clinical notes of conservative therapy trial, Circumference measurements (lymphedema) or wound measurements (venous), Photos if possible, Device usage logs, Follow-up notes showing compliance and results. **NY MEDICAID:** Requires prior approval for ALL pneumatic compression devices. Submit via ePACES or Form 361501: Diagnosis, Measurements/staging, Conservative therapy documentation, Prescription, Treatment plan. Approval typically 6 months, then reassessment for continuation. **DENIAL PREVENTION:** **CONSERVATIVE THERAPY TRIAL IS MANDATORY.** Cannot skip to device. Must document: 4-6 months trial minimum, Daily compression garment use (30-40 mmHg for venous, 20-40 mmHg for lymphedema), Elevation exercises, Lack of improvement. Measurements at multiple time points (baseline, during conservative therapy, at time of device request). Physician notes must explicitly state conservative therapy failed and device needed. Photos of affected limb(s) helpful. Prior authorization BEFORE delivery to avoid denial. --- [Due to length, I'll continue with the remaining BOC categories.
