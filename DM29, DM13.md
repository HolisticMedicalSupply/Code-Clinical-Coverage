### **HCPCS Code: E0787**

**Description:** External Ambulatory Infusion Pump, Insulin with Integrated CGM  
**STATUS: ⛔ INVALID CODE - DISCONTINUED**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:**  
**CODE INVALID since September 15, 2020.** Claims with E0787 will be DENIED as incorrectly coded. For integrated pump/CGM systems (DOS ≥9/15/2020), must bill separately: E0784 (pump) + K0554 (CGM receiver) or E0784 + E2102 (for DOS ≥4/1/2022) with rental modifiers when beneficiary meets criteria for BOTH insulin pump (per LCD L33794) AND CGM (per LCD L33822). Patient must meet all E0784 coverage criteria plus separate CGM coverage criteria.

**Medicare Reimbursement:**  
**DO NOT BILL E0787.** Claims submitted with E0787 are automatically denied. For integrated systems dated ≥9/15/2020, use E0784RR + K0554RR (rental modifiers required). Submit separate claims for pump and CGM components with all E0784 requirements plus CGM coverage documentation. Claims with E0787 from 1/1/2020-9/14/2020 may be corrected and resubmitted using proper code combination.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:**  
**CODE NOT ACTIVE in NY Medicaid system.** E0787 does NOT appear in October 2025 NY Medicaid DME Procedure Codes manual. NY Medicaid followed Medicare guidance discontinuing E0787. For integrated insulin pump/CGM systems (Tandem t:slim X2, Medtronic MiniMed), **do not bill E0787**. Must bill components separately: E0784 (pump) for intensive diabetes therapy requiring endocrinologist order + separate CGM codes per NY Medicaid CGM policy (updated October 2, 2023).

**E0787 NOT BILLABLE to NY Medicaid.** Bill separately: (1) E0784 with DVS authorization subject to all pump requirements, endocrinologist ordering requirement, credential verification; (2) K0554 (CGM receiver) or E2102/A4238 per current NY Medicaid CGM policies with separate DVS authorization. CGM coverage requires: under care of endocrinologist or provider with diabetes treatment experience, on insulin treatment/pump, regular visits to review CGM data, able to respond to alerts, treatment compliant.

### **HCPCS Code: A6591**

**Description:** External urinary catheter; non-disposable, for use with suction pump, per month  
**STATUS: ⛔ NOT COVERED**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:**  
**NOT COVERED by Medicare.** Code exists for non-disposable/reusable external urinary catheter for use with suction pump systems (monthly billing). Clinical use would parallel A6590 for external urine management with wicking material in incontinence patients.

**Medicare Reimbursement:**  
**NOT COVERED - NO FORMAL COVERAGE.** No LCD (L33803) or NCD coverage exists. Not included in Policy Article A52521.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:**  
**NOT FOUND ON NY MEDICAID FEE SCHEDULE.** Code established by CMS effective April 1, 2023 for reusable external urinary catheters used with suction pumps, intended for monthly billing of non-disposable catheter components.

**Medicare Reimbursement:**  
**NOT COVERED - CASH PAY.** No LCD coverage. PDAC contractor published coding guidance (effective April 1, 2023) for billing canister separately from pump, but Medicare does not reimburse without formal LCD. No documentation requirements, modifiers, or frequency limitations established due to non-covered status. L33612 (Suction Pumps LCD) does not include external urine management systems. Cash purchase required.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:**

### **HCPCS Code: A7002**

**Description:** Tubing, used with suction pump, each  
**STATUS: ⛔ MEDICARE NOT COVERED / ✅ NY MEDICAID COVERED**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:**

**NOT COVERED - CASH PAY ONLY.** No LCD or NCD coverage exists. Not included in L33612 (Suction Pumps) or L33803 (Urological Supplies) LCDs. PDAC contractor recognizes code for billing purposes (effective April 1, 2023) and published coding instructions for PureWick system accessories, but Medicare does not provide reimbursement without formal LCD coverage criteria.

### **HCPCS Code: E2001**

**Description:** Suction pump, home model, portable or stationary, electric, any type, for use with external urine and/or fecal management system  
**STATUS: ⛔ NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE / ⛔ NOT YET ADOPTED BY NY MEDICAID**

**Medicare Clinical Usage:**  
**NOT COVERED by Medicare for home use.** No LCD or NCD exists. E2001 replaced temporary code K1006 (effective January 1, 2024) for external urine management systems like PureWick. Used for non-invasive management of urinary/fecal incontinence via external wicking devices, primarily in female patients with urinary incontinence. Device draws urine away from body using low-pressure suction to prevent skin breakdown and reduce CAUTI risk compared to indwelling catheters.

**Medicare Reimbursement:**  
**NOT COVERED - CASH SALES ONLY.** Medicare does not have NCD for external urine management systems; LCDs/LCAs do not exist per UnitedHealthcare Medicare documentation (2025). PureWick manufacturer website states products "not covered by Medicare, Medicaid or commercial insurance—cash sales only." Some sources indicate Medicare approved coverage March 2024 but no formal LCD published. Not addressed in L33612 (Suction Pumps) or L33803 (Urological Supplies). Cash price: ~$300-500 for pump unit.

**NY Medicaid Clinical Usage:**  
**LIKELY NOT YET ADOPTED** - New code crosswalked from K1006 effective 1/1/2024. Clinical indications: permanent urinary incontinence, functional incontinence, immobility requiring non-invasive urine management. Used for female/male external catheter systems that wick urine away from body using low-pressure suction. Reduces UTI risk vs. indwelling catheters; preserves skin integrity. **Not found in NY Medicaid DME Procedure Codes manual (effective 10/1/2025) or fee schedules.**

**NY Medicaid Reimbursement:**  
**COVERAGE NOT ESTABLISHED IN NY MEDICAID SYSTEM.** E0600 (respiratory suction pump) listed at $290.66 on NY fee schedule, but E2001 not listed. Not included in NY Medicaid DME Fee Schedule or Procedure Codes manual. Would likely require Prior Authorization if considered, based on similar pump equipment patterns. Medicare approved E2001 under Part B DME (3/28/2024), but NY Medicaid coverage not yet established. Contact NY Medicaid Bureau of Medical Review (800-342-3005) for verification or submit for prior approval with clinical documentation.
