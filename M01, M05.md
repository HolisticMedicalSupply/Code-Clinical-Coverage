## KEY POLICY DIFFERENCES: MEDICARE vs NY MEDICAID

**Prior Authorization:**

- Medicare: NONE required for any cane, crutch, or walker codes
- NY Medicaid: DVS authorization (#) required for most devices; Prior Approval required for E0140, some heavy-duty walkers

**Frequency Limits:**

- Medicare: Uniform 5-year RUL for all devices
- NY Medicaid: Variable (F2=2x/lifetime, F3=once/5 years, F4=4x/year, F7=2x/year)

**Non-Covered Items:**

- Medicare: E0117 (articulating crutch), E0144 (enclosed walker) - DENIED
- NY Medicaid: E0117 and E0144 COVERED with proper documentation (major difference)

**Documentation:**
